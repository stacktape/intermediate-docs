This example shows a basic lambda function configuration.

Lambda function resource

- Short-lived serverless functions able to quickly scale up to 1000s of parallel executions with pay-per-use pricing.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      # Configures how your source code is turned into a deployment package (deployment artifact)
      #
      # - Currently supported packaging types are:
      # - `stacktape-lambda-buildpack` - Stacktape automatically builds your source code from the supplied source file path.
      # - `custom-artifact` - You provide path to your own lambda artifact. Stacktape will zip it for you if it's not zipped.
      # - Your deployment artifacts are automatically uploaded to the S3 deployment bucket.
      #
      # - Type: union (anyOf)
      # - Required: true
      #
      # - Type: object

        properties:
          # Path to the entry point of your compute resource (relative to the stacktape config file)
          #
          # - Stacktape tries to bundle all your source code with its dependencies into a single file.
          # - If a certain dependency doesn't support static bundling (because it depends on binary executable, uses dynamic require() calls, etc.),
          # Stacktape will install it and copy it to the bundle
          #
          # - Type: string

      # List of event integrations that invoke (trigger) this function
      #
      # Functions are invoked ("triggered") in reaction to an event.
      # - Connecting your lambda functions to an event integrations is automatically handled by Stacktape.
      # - Stacktape automatically adds all the permissions required to invoke the function.
      # - Each function can have multiple event integrations.
      # - Payload (data) received by the function is based on the event integration.
      #
      # - Type: array<union (anyOf)>
      # - Required: false
      events:
      # Environment variables injected to the runtime environment
      #
      # - Environment variables are often used to inject information about other parts of the infrastructure (such as database URLs, secrets, etc.).
      #
      # - Type: array<object (reference)>
      # - Required: false
      environment:
        - name: NODE_ENV
          value: production

          value: $ResourceParam(myDatabase, connectionString)
      # Runtime used to execute the function
      #
      # - Stacktape automatically detects the function's language and uses the latest runtime version associated with that language.
      # - Example: uses `nodejs22.x` for all files ending with `.js` and `.ts`.
      # - For the list of all available lambda runtimes, refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html).

      runtime: dotnet6
      # Amount of memory (in MB) available to the function during execution
      #
      # - Must be between 128 MB and 10,240 MB in 1-MB increments.
      # - Amount of CPU power available to the function is also set using memory property - it's proportionate to the amount of available memory.
      # - Function with 1797MB has a CPU power equal to 1 virtual CPU. Lambda function can have a maximum of 6 vCPUs (at 10,240 MB of RAM).

      # Connects the function to the default VPC
      #
      # > Connecting a function to the VPC makes it lose connection to the internet. (Outbound requests will fail).
      # - Functions are NOT connected to the default VPC of your stack by default.
      # - To communicate with certain resources inside your VPC, you might need to connect your function to the VPC - most commonly when accessing relational-database or redis-cluster.
      # - If your function connect to S3 (**bucket**) or DynamoDB (**dynamo-db-table**) resources using `connectTo`, VPC gateway endpoints are automatically created in the VPC so that your function can access the resources even without internet access.
      # - To learn more about VPCs, refer to [VPCs Stacktape documentation](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/vpcs).

      # - 4 different destinations are supported:
      # - SQS queue
      # - SNS topic
      # - Event bus
      # - other lambda function
      # - Destination receives both function's result (or error) and original event.
      # - To learn more about Lambda destinations, refer to [AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-destinations/).
      # - Defined using a destinations property on the function
      # - For SNS, DynamoDB and Kinesis event integrations, onFailure destination can be set per event integration.

        # Configures forwarding of logs to specified destination
        #
        # - Log forwarding is done using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) delivery stream.
        # - When using log forwarding, you will incur costs based on the amount of data being transferred to the destination (~$0.03 per transferred GB).
        # Refer to [AWS Kinesis Firehose Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3) page to see details.
        # - Currently supported destinations for logs:
        # - `http-endpoint`
        # - delivers logs to any HTTP endpoint.
        # - The endpoint must follow [Firehose request and response specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html).
        # (Many of the third party vendors are compliant with this specifications out of the box.)
        # - `datadog`
        # - delivers logs to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
        # - `highlight`
        # - delivers logs to [Highlight.io](https://www.highlight.io/) project.

      # Configures deployment (update) behaviour of the function
      #
      # - Using `deployment` you can update the function in live environment in a safe way - by shifting the traffic to the new version gradually.
      # - Gradual shift of traffic gives you opportunity to test/monitor the function during update and in a case of a problem swiftly rollback.
      # - Supports multiple strategies:
      # - **Canary10Percent5Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed five minutes later.
      # - **Canary10Percent10Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed 10 minutes later.
      # - **Canary10Percent15Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed 15 minutes later.
      # - **Canary10Percent30Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed 30 minutes later.
      # - **Linear10PercentEvery1Minute** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic every minute until all traffic is shifted.
      # - **Linear10PercentEvery2Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic every two minutes until all traffic is shifted.
      # - **Linear10PercentEvery3Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic every three minutes until all traffic is shifted.
      # - **Linear10PercentEvery10Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic every 10 minutes until all traffic is shifted.

      #
      # - CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your Lambda function at the edge - close to your users.
      # - AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
      # - The CDN is used to:
      # - reduce latency & improve load times
      # - reduce bandwidth costs
      # - reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
      # - improve security
      # - The "origin" is the resource (Lambda function) to which CDN is attached.
      # CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
      # - If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache,
      # the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
      # - If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin.

        # - When response from the origin does not contain neither `cache-control` nor `expires` headers default caching behaviour is used.
        # - Default caching behaviour depends on the type of origin the CDN is attached to:
        # - **bucket** - by default objects are cached for 6 months (or until the CDN cache is invalidated).
        # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - by default responses are not cached.

          # and lower transfer costs.
          # - The CDN compresses objects using the `Gzip` and `Brotli` compression methods.
          # - If the viewer supports both formats, Brotli version is used.

        #
        # Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:
        # - **Creates DNS records**:
        # - If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
        # - **Adds TLS certificates**
        # - If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of
        # issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource.
        # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
        # - If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.
        #
        # > To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account.
        # > This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)
        # > (collection of records managed together for a given domain)
        # > for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it.
        # > To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](https://docs.stacktape.com/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

        #
        # - You can associate `edge-lambda-function` with CDN to be executed:
        # - `onRequest` - function is executed when CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) before checking CDN cache
        # - `onResponse` - function is executed before returning the response to the client(viewer)
        #
        # - Potential use-cases for using edge functions:
        # - generating immediate HTTP response without the need to check CDN cache or forward to the origin
        # - modifying request (i.e rewrite url, headers etc) before forwarding to the origin
        # - inspection of cookies

          # > - **web-service, http-api-gateway, application-load-balancer** - Stacktape uses this trigger with pre-configured lambda to adjust headers before sending to origin
          # - `onOriginRequest` function is triggered after CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) but before the request is send to the origin:
          # - This means that function is NOT triggered when response is found in the cache (as no request to origin needs to happen)
          # - You can modify the request before forwarding it to the origin
