This example shows a basic web service configuration.

Web service resource

- Provides continuously running container with public endpoint (URL) accessible from anywhere on internet.
- TLS/SSL out of the box.
- Easy setup of scaling, healthchecks and other properties.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myWebService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # Configures CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for this service.
      #
      # - If CORS is configured using this property, CORS headers returned from your application are ignored and replaced
      #
      # > This property only works if **loadBalancing** type is `http-api-gateway`(default).
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      cors:
        # Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
        #
        # If you do not specify any additional properties, default CORS configuration is used:
        # - `AllowedMethods`: Inferred from methods used by integrations associated with the api gateway
        # - `AllowedOrigins`: `*`
        # - `AllowedHeaders`: `Content-Type`, `X-Amz-Date`, `Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, `X-Amz-Security-Token`, `X-Amz-User-Agent`
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: true
        # - Default: false
        enabled: true
        # Origins to accepts cross-domain requests from
        #
        # - Origin is a combination of scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port of the URL
        # - Example origin: https://foo.example
        #
        # - Type: array<string>
        # - Required: false
        # - Default: *
        allowedOrigins:
          - https://example.com
          - https://app.example.com
        # Allowed HTTP headers
        #
        # - Each header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header of a preflight request must match a corresponding entry in the rule.
        #
        # - Type: array<string>
        # - Required: false
        allowedHeaders:
          - Content-Type
          - Authorization
        # Allowed HTTP methods
        #
        # - By default, Stacktape determines allowed methods based on the event integrations associated with gateway
        #
        # - Type: array<object (reference)>

      # Attaches a custom domains to this Web Service
      #
      # Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources
      # (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).
      #
      # Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:
      # - **Creates DNS records**:
      # - If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
      # - **Adds TLS certificates**
      # - If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of
      # issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource.
      # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
      # - If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.
      #
      # > To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account.
      # > This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)
      # > (collection of records managed together for a given domain)
      # > for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it.

      customDomains:
      # Configures AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your Web Service
      #
      # - CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your Web Service at the edge - close to your users.
      # - AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
      # - The CDN is used to:
      # - reduce latency & improve load times
      # - reduce bandwidth costs
      # - reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin (Web Service containers)
      # - improve security
      # - CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
      # - If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache,
      # the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
      # - If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin.
      # The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.

        #
        # - Configures the caching behavior of your edge distribution (what & when should stay in cache, and when to refetch it from the origin).
        # - When response from the origin does not contain neither `cache-control` nor `expires` headers default caching behaviour is used.
        # - Default caching behaviour depends on the type of origin the CDN is attached to:
        # - **bucket** - by default objects are cached for 6 months (or until the CDN cache is invalidated).
        # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - by default responses are not cached.

          # Disables compression of the objects served by the CDN
          #
          # - Compression is enabled by default.
          # - Compression can significantly reduce the size of the responses from the CDN.
          # In some cases, less than a quarter the size of the original. This can result in a better performance
          # and lower transfer costs.
          # - The CDN compresses objects using the `Gzip` and `Brotli` compression methods.
          # - If the viewer supports both formats, Brotli version is used.
          # - The client must indicate that it accepts compressed files using the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header.

        # - `onResponse` - function is executed before returning the response to the client(viewer)
        #
        # - Potential use-cases for using edge functions:

          # > - **web-service, http-api-gateway, application-load-balancer** - Stacktape uses this trigger with pre-configured lambda to adjust headers before sending to origin
          # - `onOriginRequest` function is triggered after CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) but before the request is send to the origin:
          # - This means that function is NOT triggered when response is found in the cache (as no request to origin needs to happen)

      # - Gradual shift of traffic gives you opportunity to test/monitor the workload during update and in a case of a problem quickly rollback.
      # - Deployment supports multiple strategies:
      # - **Canary10Percent5Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed five minutes later.
      # - **Canary10Percent15Minutes** - Shifts 10 percent of traffic in the first increment. The remaining 90 percent is deployed 15 minutes later.

        # Types of EC2 instances(VMs) that can be used
        #
        # - EC2 instances are automatically added or removed to meet the scaling needs of your compute resource(see also `scaling` property).
        # - When using `instanceTypes`, **we recommend to specify only one instance type and to NOT set `cpu` or `memory` properties**.
        # By doing so, Stacktape will set the cpu and memory to fit the instance precisely - resulting in the optimal resource utilization.
        # - Stacktape leverages [ECS Managed Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-auto-scaling.html) with target utilization 100%.
        # This means that there are no unused EC2 instances(unused = not running your workload/service) running. Unused EC2 instances are terminated.
        # - Ordering in `instanceTypes` list matters. Instance types which are higher on the list are preferred over the instance types which are lower on the list.
        # Only when instance type higher on the list is not available, next instance type on the list will be used.

        # - Creates a warm pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that are kept in a `Stopped` state, ready to be quickly launched when scaling up.
        # - Warm pool instances are maintained between the desired capacity count and the maximum capacity count of your Auto Scaling group.
        # - When scaling up is needed, instances from the warm pool are started much faster than launching new instances from scratch.
        # - **Cost optimization**: Instances in the warm pool are in `Stopped` state, so you only pay for EBS storage, not for compute time.
        # - Improves scaling performance by reducing the time needed to launch new instances during traffic spikes.
        # - The warm pool size is automatically managed based on your workload's scaling configuration.
