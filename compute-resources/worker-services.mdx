title: "Worker Services"
order: 120
---

# Overview

Private service is a isolated running container (not accessible from outside). This type of compute resource is ideal
for continuous processing jobs (such as event processing). Main features of worker service are:

- scalability - automatically add/remove containers based on CPU or memory usage (within your
  [specified thresholds](#scaling)),
- zero downtime deployments,
- multiple options to provide [container image](#image), including zero-config packaging of code for
  Typescript/Javascript, Python, Java and Go,
- no hassle with managing and patching servers or VMs,
- seamless connectivity with other resources.

# Under the hood

Under the hood Stacktape uses [AWS ECS(Elastic Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) to orchestrate your
containers. Containers can be ran using Fargate or EC2 instances:

- [Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html) - technology which allows you
  to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. This means you don't have to worry about
  administration tasks such as scaling, VM security, OS security & much more.
- [EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - VMs running on AWS

<br />

**ECS Services** are self healing - if your container instance dies for any reason, it is automatically replaced with a
healthy instance. They [auto-scale from the box](#scaling)(within configured boundaries) leveraging the
[AWS Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/what-is-application-auto-scaling.html)
service.

# When to use

If you are unsure which resource type is best suitable for your app, following table provides short comparison of all
container-based resource types offered by Stacktape.

| **Resource type**                                                         | **Description**                                                                      | **Use-cases**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [web-service](/compute-resources/web-services/)                           | continuously running container with **public endpoint and URL**                      | public APIs, websites                          |
| [private-service](/compute-resources/private-services/)                   | continuously running container with **private endpoint**                             | private APIs, services                         |
| [worker-service](/compute-resources/worker-services/)                     | continuously running container **not accessible from outside**                       | continuous processing                          |
| [multi-container-workload](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads/) | custom multi container workload - you can customize accessibility for each container | more complex use-cases requiring customization |
| [batch-job](/compute-resources/batch-jobs/)                               | simple container **job** - container is destroyed after job is done                  | one-off/scheduled processing jobs              |

## Advantages

- **Control over underlying environment** - Worker service can run any Docker image or image built using your own
  Dockerfile.
- **Price for compute resources with predictable load** - Compared to functions, worker services are cheaper if your
  compute resource has a predictable load.
- **Load-balanced and auto-scalable** - Worker services can automatically [horizontally scale](#scaling) based on the
  CPU and Memory utilization.
- **High availability** - Worker services run in multiple Availability Zones.
- **Secure by default** - Underlying environment is securely managed by AWS.

## Disadvantages

- **Scaling speed** - Unlike lambda functions that scale almost instantly, worker service requires more time - from
  several seconds to few minutes to add another container.

- **Not fully serverless** - While worker services can automatically scale up and down, they can't scale to 0. This
  means, if your compute resource is unused, you are still paying for at least one instance (minimum ~$8/month)

# Basic usage

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

> Example worker service config

```ts
import myContinuouslyRunningApp from './my-app';

const app = myContinuouslyRunningApp();

app.run();
```

> Example server container written in Typescript (main.ts)

<br />

<PropertiesTable definitionName="WorkerService" />

# Image

- Worker service is a running instance of a Docker image.
- The image of the container can be supplied in 4 different ways:
  - images built using [stacktape-image-buildpack](/configuration/packaging#stacktape-image-buildpack-worker-service)
  - images built using [external-buildpack](/configuration/packaging#external-buildpack-worker-service)
  - images built from the [custom-dockerfile](/configuration/packaging#custom-dockerfile-worker-service)
  - [prebuilt-images](/configuration/packaging#prebuilt-image-worker-service)

# Environment variables

Most commonly used types of environment variables:

-   Static - string, number or boolean (will be stringified).
-   Result of a [custom directive](/configuration/directives/#custom-directives).
-   Referenced property of another resource (using **$ResourceParam** directive). To learn more, refer to [referencing parameters guide](/configuration/referencing-parameters/). If you are using environment variables to inject information about resources into your script, see also property [connectTo](/configuration/scripts/#connecting-to-resources) which simplifies this process.
-   Value of a [secret](/resources/secrets/) (using [$Secret directive](/configuration/directives/#secret)).

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      environment:
        - name: STATIC_ENV_VAR
          value: my-env-var
        - name: DYNAMICALLY_SET_ENV_VAR
          value: $MyCustomDirective('input-for-my-directive')
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: $ResourceParam('myDatabase', 'host')
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          value: $Secret('dbSecret.password')
      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

# Healthcheck

The purpose of the container health check is to monitor the health of the container from the inside.

**Once an essential container of an instance is determined UNHEALTHY, the instance is automatically replaced with a new
one.**

<PropertiesTable definitionName="ContainerHealthCheck" searchForReferencesInDefinition="WorkerServiceProps" />

<br />

- Example: A shell command sends a `curl` request every 20 seconds to determine if the service is available. If the
  request fails (or doesn't return in 5 seconds), the command returns with non-zero exit code, and the healthcheck is
  considered failed.

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      internalHealthCheck:
        healthCheckCommand: ['CMD-SHELL', 'curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1']
        intervalSeconds: 20
        timeoutSeconds: 5
        startPeriodSeconds: 150
        retries: 2
      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

# Shutdown

- When a running worker service instance is deregistered (removed), all running containers receive a `SIGTERM` signal.
- By default, you then have 2 seconds to clean up. After 2 seconds, your process receives a `SIGKILL` signal.
- You can set the timeout by using `stopTimeout` property (must be between 2 - 120 seconds).
- Setting stop timeout can help you give container the time to "finish the job" or to "cleanup" when deploying new
  version of container or when deleting the service.

```ts
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.info('Received SIGTERM signal. Cleaning up and exiting process...');

  // Finish any outstanding requests, or close a database connection...

  process.exit(0);
});
```

> Cleaning up before container shutdown.

# Logging

- Every time your code outputs (prints) something to the `stdout` or `stderr`, your log will be captured and stored in a
  AWS CloudWatch log group.
- You can browse your logs in 2 ways:
  - Browse logs in the AWS CloudWatch console. To get direct link to your logs you have 2 options:
    1. Go to [stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/). Link is among information about your stack and
       resource.
    2. You can use `stacktape stack-info` command.
  - Browse logs using [stacktape logs command](/cli/commands/logs) that will print logs to the console.
- Please note that storing log data can become costly over time. To avoid excessive charges, you can configure
  `retentionDays`.

## Forwarding logs

It is possible to forward logs to the third party services/databases. See page
[Forwarding logs](/configuration/log-forwarding/) for more information and examples.

# Resources

In `resources` section, you specify amounts of **cpu/memory** and **EC2 instance types** available to your service.

<br />

There are two ways to run your containers:

1. using **Fargate**

   - Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine for running containers without having to manage underlying
     instances (servers).
   - With Fargate you only need to specify `cpu` and `memory` required for your service.
   - While slightly more expensive, using Fargate is often preferred in strictly regulated industries since running
     containers on Fargate meets the standards for PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 1,
     SOC 2, SOC 3 out of the box.

2. using **EC2 instances**

   - EC2 instances are virtual machines (VMs) ran on AWS cloud.
   - Containers are placed on the EC2 instances which are added and removed depending on service needs.
   - You can choose instance type that suit your resource requirements the best.

<Info>

Whether you chose to use Fargate or EC2 instances, your containers are running securely within
[your VPC](#default-vpc-connection).

</Info>

Following applies when configuring `resources` section of your service:

-   When specifying resources there are two underlying compute engines to use:
    
    -   **Fargate** - abstracts the server and cluster management away from the user, allowing them to run containers without managing the underlying servers, simplifying deployment and management of applications but offering less control over the computing environment.
    -   **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** - provides granular control over the underlying servers (instances). By choosing `instanceTypes` you get complete control over the computing environment and the ability to optimize for specific workloads.
-   **To use Fargate**: Do NOT specify `instanceTypes` and specify `cpu` and `memory` properties.
    
-   **To use EC2 instances**: specify `instanceTypes`.

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="ContainerWorkloadResourcesConfig"
  searchForReferencesInDefinition="WorkerServiceProps"
/>

## Using Fargate

If you do not specify `instanceTypes` property in `resources` section, Fargate is used to run your containers.

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example using Fargate

## Using EC2 instances

If you specify `instanceTypes` property in `resources` section, EC2 instances are used to run your containers.

<br />

-   EC2 instances are automatically added or removed to meet the scaling needs of your compute resource(see also `scaling` property).
-   When using `instanceTypes`, **we recommend to specify only one instance type and to NOT set `cpu` or `memory` properties**. By doing so, Stacktape will set the cpu and memory to fit the instance precisely - resulting in the optimal resource utilization.
-   Stacktape leverages [ECS Managed Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-auto-scaling.html) with target utilization 100%. This means that there are no unused EC2 instances(unused = not running your workload/service) running. Unused EC2 instances are terminated.
-   Ordering in `instanceTypes` list matters. Instance types which are higher on the list are preferred over the instance types which are lower on the list. Only when instance type higher on the list is not available, next instance type on the list will be used.
-   For exhaustive list of available EC2 instance types refer to [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

To ensure that your containers are running on patched and up-to-date EC2 instances, your instances are automatically refreshed (replaced) once a week(Sunday 00:00 UTC). Your compute resource stays available throughout this process.

```yml
resources:
  myWebService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      resources:
        instanceTypes:
          - c5.large
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example using EC2 instances

### Placing containers on EC2

Stacktape aims to achieve 100% utilization of your EC2 instances. However this is not always possible and following
behavior can be expected:

- If you only specify one type in `instanceTypes` and you do NOT set `memory` and `cpu` then Stacktape sets `memory` and
  `cpu` to fit the EC2 instance type precisely(see also [Default cpu and memory](#default-cpu-and-memory) section).

  This means that if your service scales(new instance of service is added), new EC2 instance is added as well.

- If you specify `cpu` and `memory` properties alongside `instanceTypes`, they will be respected. If the EC2 instance is
  larger (has more resources) than specified `cpu` and `memory`, AWS places instances of your service on available EC2
  instances using binpack strategy. This strategy aims to put as many instances of your service on the available EC2
  instances as possible(to maximize utilization).

### Default cpu and memory

- If you do not specify `cpu` then entire capacity of EC2 instance CPU is shared between containers running on the EC2
  instance.
- If you do not specify `memory` then `memory` is set to a maximum possible value so that all EC2 instance types listed
  in `instanceTypes` are able provide that amount of memory.

  In other words: Stacktape sets the memory so that the smallest instance type in `instanceTypes`(in terms of memory) is
  able to provide that amount of memory.

### Using warm pool

You can enable a warm pool for your container service by setting the `enableWarmPool` property to `true` in your
resources configuration. This feature provides several benefits for scaling performance and cost optimization:

- **Only works when you specify exactly one instance type in `instanceTypes`**. Warm pools are not supported with mixed
  instance types.
- Creates a warm pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that are kept in a `Stopped` state, ready to be quickly launched
  when scaling up.
- Warm pool instances are maintained between the desired capacity count and the maximum capacity count of your Auto
  Scaling group.
- When scaling up is needed, instances from the warm pool are started much faster than launching new instances from
  scratch.
- **Cost optimization**: Instances in the warm pool are in `Stopped` state, so you only pay for EBS storage, not for
  compute time.
- Improves scaling performance by reducing the time needed to launch new instances during traffic spikes.
- The warm pool size is automatically managed based on your workload's scaling configuration.
- For more details, see
  [AWS Auto Scaling warm pools documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html).

```yml
resources:
  myWebService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      resources:
        instanceTypes:
          - c5.large
        # {start-highlight}
        enableWarmPool: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Scaling

In `scaling` section, you can configure scaling behavior of your service. You can configure:

- Minimum and maximum amount of concurrently running **instances of your service**.
- Conditions which trigger the scaling (up or down) using a scaling policy.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="ContainerWorkloadScaling" searchForReferencesInDefinition="WorkerServiceProps" />

## Scaling policy

- A scaling policy specifies CPU and memory metric thresholds which trigger the scaling process.

- Depending on the thresholds, the compute resource can either scale out (add instances) or scale in (remove instances).

- If both `keepAvgCpuUtilizationUnder` and `keepAvgMemoryUtilizationUnder` are used, the compute resource will scale-out
  **if one of the metrics** is above the target value. However, to scale in, **both of these metrics** need to be below
  their respective target values.

- Scaling policy is more aggressive in adding capacity then removing capacity. For example, if the policy's specified
  metric reaches its target value, the policy assumes that your application is already heavily loaded. So it responds by
  adding capacity proportional to the metric value as fast as it can. The higher the metric, the more capacity is added.

- When the metric falls below the target value, the policy expects that utilization will eventually increase again.
  Therefore it slows down the scale-in process by removing capacity only when utilization passes a threshold that is far
  enough below the target value (usually 20% lower).

<PropertiesTable definitionName="ContainerWorkloadScalingPolicy" searchForReferencesInDefinition="WorkerServiceProps" />

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 1024
      # {start-highlight}
      scaling:
        minInstances: 1
        maxInstances: 5
        scalingPolicy:
          keepAvgMemoryUtilizationUnder: 80
          keepAvgCpuUtilizationUnder: 80
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example usage of scaling configuration

# Storage

- Each worker service instance has access to its own ephemeral storage. It's removed after the worker service instances
  is removed.
- It has a fixed size of 20GB.
- If you have 2 concurrently running worker service instances, they do not share this storage.
- To store data persistently, consider using [Buckets](/resources/buckets).

# Accessing other resources

- For most of the AWS resources, resource-to-resource communication is not allowed by default. This helps to enforce
  security and resource isolation. Access must be explicitly granted using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (Identity
  and Access Management) permissions.

- Access control of [Relational Databases](/resources/relational-databases) is not managed by IAM. These resources are
  not "cloud-native" by design and have their own access control mechanism (connection string with username and
  password). They are accessible by default, and you don't need to grant any extra IAM permissions. You can further
  restrict the access to your relational databases by configuring their
  [access control mode](/resources/relational-databases/#accessibility).

- Stacktape automatically handles IAM permissions for the underlying AWS services that it creates (i.e. granting web
  services permission to write logs to Cloudwatch, allowing worker services to communicate with their event source and
  many others).

<br />

If your compute resource needs to communicate with other infrastructure components, you need to add permissions
manually. You can do this in 2 ways:

## Using connectTo

- List of resource names or AWS services that this service will be able to access (basic IAM permissions will be granted
  automatically). Granted permissions differ based on the resource.
- Works only for resources managed by Stacktape in `resources` section (not arbitrary Cloudformation resources)
- This is useful if you don't want to deal with IAM permissions yourself. Handling permissions using raw IAM role
  statements can be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, when using `connectTo` property, Stacktape
  **automatically injects information about resource** you are connecting to as environment variables into your
  workload.

```yml
resources:
  photosBucket:
    type: bucket

  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/index.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        # access to the bucket
        - photosBucket
        # access to AWS SES
        - aws:ses
      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
```

<br />

By referencing resources (or services) in `connectTo` list, Stacktape automatically:

-   configures correct compute resource's **IAM role permissions** if needed
-   sets up correct **security group rules** to allow access if needed
-   **injects relevant environment variables** containing information about resource you are connecting to into the compute resource's runtime
    -   names of environment variables use upper-snake-case and are in form `STP_[RESOURCE_NAME]_[VARIABLE_NAME]`,
    -   examples: `STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `STP_MY_EVENT_BUS_ARN`,
    -   list of injected variables for each resource type can be seen below.

## Using iamRoleStatements

- List of raw IAM role statement objects. These will be appended to the worker service's role.
- Allows you to set granular control over your worker service's permissions.
- Can be used to give access to _any_ Cloudformation resource

```yml
resources:
  myWorkerService:
    type: worker-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: server/index.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      iamRoleStatements:
        - Resource:

# Default VPC connection

- Certain AWS services (such as [Relational Databases](/resources/relational-databases)) must be connected to a
  [VPC (Virtual private cloud)](/user-guides/vpcs) to be able to run. For stacks that include these resources, Stacktape
  does 2 things:
  - creates a default VPC
  - connects the VPC-requiring resources to the default VPC.
- worker services are connected to the default VPC of your stack by default. This means that worker services can
  communicate with resources that have their accessibility mode set to `vpc` without any extra configuration.
- To learn more about VPCs and accessibility modes, refer to [VPC docs](/user-guides/vpcs),
  [accessing relational databases](/resources/relational-databases#accessibility),
  [accessing redis clusters](/resources/redis-clusters#accessibility) and
  [accessing MongoDb Atlas clusters](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters#accessibility).
