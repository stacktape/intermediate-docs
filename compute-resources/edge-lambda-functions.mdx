# Overview

- Edge lambda function is a scalable and highly available computing resource that runs your code closer to users of your
  application, improving performance and latency.

- Functions are globally distributed across regional CDN cache locations (13 locations spread across the globe), which
  makes it possible to execute them closer to the end user

- Lambda functions are **"serverless"** and fully managed. You don't have to worry about provisioning and managing
  servers, container and OS security, patching, scaling & many other DevOps tasks.

- Supported runtimes are Node.js (Javascript and Typescript) and Python.

- Similarly to regular Lambda Functions, you only pay for the compute time you use - there is no charge when your code
  is not running.

- Use-cases for Edge lambda functions: performing user authentication, cookie inspection, validation of requests, and
  many more.

# Under the hood

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/). Lambda@Edge functions are always
associated with CDNs and are triggered when request/response is sent to/from the CDN.

# When to use

<NegativeMargin />

## Advantages

- **Low latency** - By running code closer to end user, latency and overall performance is improved.
- **Scalability** - Run your code without necessity to manage any infrastructure. Similarly to regular
  [functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions), Edge lambda functions provide high scalability.
- **Pay-per-use** - You only pay for the compute time you consume (rounded to 1ms). Refer to
  [Lambda@Edge pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) in AWS docs.

## Disadvantages

- **Limited execution environment** - (Applies to `onRequest`/`onResponse` lambdas) Your Edge lambda functions are
  limited to 128MB of memory and maximum execution time of 5 seconds.

# Basic usage

-   You can associate `edge-lambda-function` with CDN to be executed:
    
    -   `onRequest` - function is executed when CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) before checking CDN cache
    -   `onResponse` - function is executed before returning the response to the client(viewer)
-   Potential use-cases for using edge functions:
    
    -   generating immediate HTTP response without the need to check CDN cache or forward to the origin
    -   modifying request (i.e rewrite url, headers etc) before forwarding to the origin
    -   inspection of cookies
    -   inspection/validation of authorization headers and tokens

<br />

In the following example we are using `edge-lambda-function` to validate `Authorization` header of each incoming user
request. If user is not authorized, he is redirected to login page.

```yml
resources:
  # {start-highlight}
  authFunction:
    type: edge-lambda-function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: auth-function.ts
  # {stop-highlight}

  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        edgeFunctions:
          onRequest: authFunction
        # {stop-highlight}
```

```ts
const validateAuthorizationToken = (token) => {
  // perform some validation
  return true;
};

export default async (event) => {
  const { request } = event.Records[0].cf;
  const { headers } = request;

  const authorizationToken = headers.authorization?.[0]?.value;

  const userAuthorized = validateAuthorizationToken(authorizationToken);

  // if user is not authorized, redirect him to login page
  if (!userAuthorized) {
    return {
      status: '302',
      headers: {
        location: [
          {
            key: 'Location',
            value: '/login'
          }
        ],
        'cache-control': [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate'
          }
        ]
      }
    };
  }

  // after we validated that user is authorized, we can return the request
  // request will be forwarded to origin
  return request;
};
```

# Event structure

Event delivered to the function differs based on whether you are using `onRequest` or `onResponse` trigger:

- [Event structure for `onRequest` function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-event-structure.html#example-viewer-request)
- [Event structure for `onResponse` function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-event-structure.html#lambda-event-structure-response-viewer)

# On request trigger

When using `onRequest` trigger with edge-lambda-function you can:

1. **Return response from function** - In this case the response is served to the client directly and the request is NOT
   forwarded to the origin.
2. **Forward request to origin** - You can modify the request (path, body, headers ...) before forwarding to origin or
   you can forward it as is.

Following example code combines both options:

- If user is authorized - forwards request to the origin
- If user is not authorized - return redirect response to login page

```ts
const validateAuthorizationToken = (token) => {
  // perform some validation
  return true;
};

export default async (event) => {
  const { request } = event.Records[0].cf;
  const { headers } = request;

  const authorizationToken = headers.authorization?.[0]?.value;

  const userAuthorized = validateAuthorizationToken(authorizationToken);

  // if user is not authorized, redirect him to login page
  if (!userAuthorized) {
    return {
      status: '302',
      headers: {
        location: [
          {
            key: 'Location',
            value: '/login'
          }
        ],
        'cache-control': [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate'
          }
        ]
      }
    };
  }

  // after we validated that user is authorized, we can return the request
  // request will be forwarded to origin
  return request;
};
```

# On response trigger

When using `onResponse` trigger with edge-lambda-function you can modify the response before returning.

In following example we are using it to set response cookie.

```ts
export default async (event) => {
  const { response } = event.Records[0].cf;

  response.headers['set-cookie'] = [
    {
      key: 'Set-Cookie',
      value: 'my-experimental-cookie=cookie-value'
    }
  ];

  return response;
};
```

> Code of the function

```yml
resources:
  # {start-highlight}
  cookieFunction:
    type: edge-lambda-function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: set-cookie.ts
  # {stop-highlight}

  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        edgeFunctions:
          onResponse: cookieFunction
        # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example config

# Packaging

Refer to [packaging docs](/configuration/packaging#packaging-lambda-functions).

<Warning>

When using cdn-lambda function with `onRequest` or `onResponse` trigger the zipped package size is limited to 1 MB.

</Warning>

# Logging

-   Information about the function invocation and function logs (stdout and stderr) are automatically sent to a pre-created CloudWatch log group.
-   By default, logs are retained for 180 days..
-   You can see the logs in the log group page in the AWS CloudWatch console. You can use `stacktape stack-info` command to get a direct link.

Edge lambda functions are executed in multiple locations (regions) across the world depending on the cdn edge location which serves the client request (usually the location closest to the client).

As a result the logs for the function executed in given region are delivered to a log group in that region. The list of regions where edge lambda can execute: **us-east-1**, **us-east-2**, **us-west-1**, **us-west-2**, **ap-south-1**, **ap-northeast-1**, **ap-northeast-2**, **ap-southeast-1**, **ap-southeast-2**, **eu-west-1**, **eu-west-2**, **eu-central-1**, **sa-east-1**

# Accessing other resources

- For most of the AWS resources, resource-to-resource communication is not allowed by default. This helps to enforce
  security and resource isolation. Access must be explicitly granted using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (Identity
  and Access Management) permissions.

- Stacktape automatically handles IAM permissions for the underlying AWS services that it creates (i.e. granting cdn
  lambda function permission to write logs to Cloudwatch).

- If your function needs to communicate with other infrastructure components, you need to add permissions manually. You
  can do this in 2 ways listed below.

## Using connectTo

- List of resource names or AWS services that this function will be able to access (basic IAM permissions will be
  granted automatically). Granted permissions differ based on the resource.
- Works only for resources managed by Stacktape in `resources` section (not arbitrary Cloudformation resources)
- This is useful if you don't want to deal with IAM permissions yourself. Handling permissions using raw IAM role
  statements can be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, when using `connectTo` property, Stacktape
  **automatically injects information about resource** you are connecting to as environment variables into your compute
  resource.

```yml
resources:
  authFunction:
    type: edge-lambda-function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: auth-function.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        # access to the dynamo table
        - myDynamoTable
        # access to AWS SES
        - aws:ses
      # {stop-highlight}

  myDynamoTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: id
          type: string
```

<br />

By referencing resources (or services) in `connectTo` list, Stacktape automatically:

-   configures correct compute resource's **IAM role permissions** if needed
-   sets up correct **security group rules** to allow access if needed
-   **injects relevant environment variables** containing information about resource you are connecting to into the compute resource's runtime
    -   names of environment variables use upper-snake-case and are in form `STP_[RESOURCE_NAME]_[VARIABLE_NAME]`,
    -   examples: `STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `STP_MY_EVENT_BUS_ARN`,
    -   list of injected variables for each resource type can be seen below.

Injecting of environment variables does not work for edge lambda functions.

Using connectTo with resources which are protected within VPC does not work, as edge lambda functions are distributed across globe and are not part of VPC.

  

Granted permissions and injected environment variables are different depending on resource type:

  

`Bucket`

-   **Permissions:**
    -   list objects in a bucket
    -   create / get / delete / tag object in a bucket

## Using iamRoleStatements

- List of raw IAM role statement objects. These will be appended to the function's role.
- Allows you to set granular control over your function's permissions.
- Can be used to give access to _any_ Cloudformation resource

<Warning>

Be advised when accessing resources from edge-lambda-functions. While your stack(and the resources you are accessing)
are deployed in a specific region, the function can be executed in any edge location around the world. This might result
in **higher latencies** when function is accessing the resource from a more distant region.

<br />

Example:

1. You have stack with a bucket and a edge lambda function (which has access granted to the bucket) deployed in region
   **eu-west-1**.
2. Request to CDN comes to **us-east-1** region.
3. The function is executed in **us-east-1** region. Due to network delays the communication between the function and
   the bucket might be slower.

</Warning>
