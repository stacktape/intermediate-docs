## 1 - Select Preset

To start writing faster, select one of the template presets.

This tutorial uses `API running in container with SQL database` preset.

![Selecting preset](../static/getting-started/first-deploy/docs5.2.png)

When hovering over sections of the template, you can see the docs relevant to the sections.

Also, notice that there is a **cost estimator** in the bottom right corner of the config editor. Estimated costs will
appear once you configure sections that influence the price

## 2 - Configure Container

After selecting the preset, we need to configure a few sections.

Continue by configuring container resources (by clicking `CLICK_TO_CONFIGURE_CONTAINER_RESOURCES`).

In this tutorial, we use `1 vCPU` and `1024 MB` memory.

Next, configure container packaging (by clicking `CLICK_TO_CONFIGURE_CONTAINER_PACKAGING`).

Packaging section is used to specify the container image. Select the option that suits your needs.

In this tutorial, we use `Stacktape native builder`. With this packaging type, we only need to specify an entry point of
the application, and Stacktape will build the image from the source code during deployment.

Next, configure container environment variables (by clicking `CLICK_TO_CONFIGURE_ENVIRONMENT`).

We add an environment variable `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` - the value is a parameter referenced from the SQL database
`mainDatabase` specified in the template. This parameter will be resolved during deployment.

<Info>

Since the `webService` references database `mainDatabase` in `connectTo` list, **parameters of the database are
automatically injected into the container**.

For demonstration, we have assigned the database connection string to `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` variable. However, the
connection string is also injected as `STP_MAIN_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` variable.

</Info>

## 3 - Configure Database

First, we configure the database password.

We recommend creating a [secret](https://docs.stacktape.com/security-resources/secrets/) and referencing it in the
template for enhanced security of sensitive information. You can create and manage secrets in the
[Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/secrets).

To simplify this tutorial, we use a plain string to specify the password.

Next, configure the database's compute resources by specifying the size of the primary instance.

We use the `db.t4g.small` instance.

## 4 - Configure Migration Script

In this step, we add a script to our config. Scripts are used to specify actions (custom script or command) to be
executed during the deployment lifecycle.

Scripts can be used for anything but are most commonly used for:

- triggering application build before deployment
- seeding database data after deployment
- triggering database migration after deployment

In this tutorial, we create a script that performs the database migration command after each deployment.

![Adding script](../static/getting-started/first-deploy/docs18.1.png)

Configuring script:

1. **Script name** - an arbitrary name for the script. We use `databaseMigration`,
2. **Script trigger** - a hook that will determine when the script is executed (we use `After deploy`),
3. **Script type** - we use `Local script`. To see other types of scripts, refer to
   [our docs](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/),
4. **Command** - the command to be executed. We use `npx prisma db push` as our application uses Prisma d,
5. **Current working directory** - working directory for the script execution relative to the project root. By default,
   a project's root directory is the working directory,
6. **Connect to** - we use `connect to` to automatically inject environment variables (such as database connection
   string) into our script.
