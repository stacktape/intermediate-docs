# Overview and basic usage

Opens interactive config editor in the default browser

<br />

- You will need to allow the browser windows to access your local file system (so that Stacktape can write the changes
  to the config file)
- The changes made to the configuration in the web editor are automatically synced to the local stacktape configuration
- Be default, opens `stacktape.yml` config file in the current working directory. To use another config file, use the
  `--configPath` options
