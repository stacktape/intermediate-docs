# Overview and basic usage

Runs the compute resource in a development mode

<br />

- Dev mode can be used to develop and debug your applications or to run integration tests.
- The development mode does the following:
- For `container workloads`:
  - All of the container ports specified in the `events` section will be mapped to the host.
  - Container's `environment` variables referenced by `$ResourceParam` and `$Secret` directives are automatically
    downloaded and injected to the workload.
  - Temporary credentials of the container's
    [assumed role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) are injected to the
    workload. This means that your locally running container will have the exact same IAM permissions as the deployed
    version.
  - The local emulation requires a deployed stack. Use the `--disableEmulation` flag if you want to locally run a
    workload that has not yet been deployed (without emulation).
  - Logs from the container are continuously pretty-printed to the console.
  - You must specify the name of the container to run using the `--container` option.
- For `lambda functions`:
  - The lambda function is quickly and efficiently re-deployed without using Cloudformation.
  - Logs of the lambda function are automatically download from Cloudwatch and continuously pretty-printed to the
    console
  - No emulation is required as the lambda function runs in the exact same environment as in the production
- The compute resource is re-built and restarted/re-deployed, when you either:
  - use the `--watch` flag and one of your source code files changes
  - type `rs + enter` to the terminal
