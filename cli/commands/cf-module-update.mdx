# Overview and basic usage

Updates the specified AWS CloudFormation infrastructure module private types to the newest available compatible version.

<br />

- AWS CloudFormation infrastructure modules are used to integrated 3rd party services to your AWS CloudFormation stack.
- If the API of the 3rd party service provider changes (this happens very rarely), use this command to update
  Stacktape's infrastructure modules available in your account to the latest version (supporting the new API).
