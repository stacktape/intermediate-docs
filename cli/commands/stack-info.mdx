# Overview and basic usage

Prints information about the specified stack.

<br />

You can get the information in 2 ways:

- **simple** (default): prints helpful links and parameters of the deployed stack to the terminal.
- **detailed** (used if you specify the `--detailed` flag): saves detailed information about the stack to a file. By
  default, the output is saved to `stack-info.yaml`. This can be configured using `--outFile` and `--outFormat` options.

In the **detailed** mode:

- If the stack is deployed and you specify `projectName`, `stage` and `region` you'll get overview of the deployed
  stack.

- If the stack is deployed and you additionally supply a configuration (stacktape template), you will see both resources
  from configuration and deployed resources in the result. Depending on the difference between configuration and
  deployed resources, status of the resource can be either `DEPLOYED`, `TO_BE_CREATED` or `TO_BE_DELETED`, suggesting
  what will happen to the resource if you deploy (update) the stack.

- If the stack is NOT deployed and you specify `projectName`, `--stage`, `--region` and supply a configuration, you'll
  get an overview of resources that will be created if you deploy the stack.

Sensitive values (such as database credentials) are omitted by default. If you want to include them, use
`--showSensitiveValues` flag.
