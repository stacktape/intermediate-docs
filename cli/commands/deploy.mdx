# Overview and basic usage

Deploys the stack (specified stage of your project) to AWS.

<br />

- If the stack doesn't exist, creates a new one. If the stack already exists, updates it.
- Requires a valid stacktape configuration file in the current working directory or configuring a path to the config
  file using `--configPath` option.
