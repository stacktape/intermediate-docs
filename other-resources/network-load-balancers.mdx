# Overview

- Network Load balancer is an entry-point to your application. Load balancer routes traffic to your application and
  integrates easily with compute resources of your stack such as
  [multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads#network-load-balancer-event).
- Network load balancers are used to communicate with your containers using the TCP protocol.
- You can offload SSL/TLS termination to the load-balancer instead of handling it as a part of your application.
- You can easily configure custom domain names for your net.

# Under the hood

Network load balancer is an abstraction which under the hood uses
[AWS Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html).

# When to use

A network load balancer is a good fit for applications where you need custom TCP protocol (other than HTTP/HTTPS). If
your application uses HTTP/HTTPS, we advise to use [application load balancer](/resources/application-load-balancers)
instead.

## Advantages

- **Predictable pricing** - Network load balancers have a predictable pricing model which can be
  [found here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3). Even though network-load-balancers
  have fixed base price per month (as opposed to http-api-gateways, where you only pay for requests), when traffic is
  high network-load-balancer can be cheaper.
- **Scaling** - Network load balancer is designed to handle traffic as it grows and can load balance millions of
  requests/sec.
- **Health checks** - When a network load balancer is used with multi-container-workloads, the load balancer
  periodically checks the health of target containers. It only sends requests to healthy ones and automatically notifies
  multi-container-workload to replace unhealthy containers.
- **Ease of use** - Integrate with compute resources of your stack with few lines of config
- **Security** - You can offload SSL/TLS termination to the load-balancer instead of handling it as a part of your
  application. This means that any communication between load-balancer and client can be encrypted.

## Disadvantages

- Fixed price base - You are paying ~20$/month for network-load-balancer even if it is sitting idle.
- Network load balancer does not support other workloads than multi-container-workloads.

# Integrating with compute resources

By creating event integration on
[multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads#network-load-balancer-event), you are telling
network load balancer to forward all of the traffic to the specified container.

Each integration must specify:

- `loadBalancerName` and `listenerPort`. These are the name of the load balancer and its port that will forward the
  traffic to the container.
- `containerPort` - port on the container that will receive the traffic.

resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'network-load-balancer'
    properties:
      listeners:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TLS

# Custom domain names

If you do not have a custom domain and want one, read the section
[Registering domain](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#registering-domain) on the _Domains and TLS
certificates_ page.

If you already have an existing domain and you wish to use it with your app, there are two approaches:

1. [Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs](#using-stacktape-to-manage-domain-and-certs) - you must use Route53 in
   your AWS account as your DNS.
2. [Using 3rd party DNS provider](#using-3rd-party-dns) - such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare etc. You must handle domains and
   generate certificates yourself.

For more information about domain management options, refer to
[Domains and TLS certificates](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/) page.

## Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs

Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).

Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:

-   **Creates DNS records**:
    -   If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
-   **Adds TLS certificates**
    -   If you do not specify custom `listeners` or your listeners use TLS, Stacktape takes care of issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource. This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
    -   If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns` on the listener.

To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account. This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) (collection of records managed together for a given domain) for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it. To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'network-load-balancer'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - my-app.mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}
      listeners:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TLS
```

## Using 3rd party DNS

To use 3rd party DNS provider you must:

1. Create/import a custom TLS certificate for your domain in
   [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/certificates/list). Copy certificate ARN; you will need it in
   the next step.
2. Configure listener (more info on [listeners here](configure-custom-listeners)) on your load balancer with your custom
   certificate using the copied ARN.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'network-load-balancer'
    properties:
      listeners:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TLS
          # {start-highlight}
          customCertificateArns:
            - arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:999999999999:certificate/8ab817b5-c4fa-4b1d-8b72-d6082cb40351
          # {stop-highlight}

  myWorkload:
    type: 'multi-container-workload'
    properties:
      containers:
        - name: container1
          packaging:
            type: stacktape-image-buildpack
            properties:
              entryfilePath: containers/ts-container.ts
          events:
            - type: network-load-balancer
              properties:
                loadBalancerName: myLoadBalancer
                listenerPort: 8080
                containerPort: 8080
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
```

> Listener with custom certificate

3. After you deploy your load balancer, you can find the domain name in
   [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/projects) in:

   _Your project and stage_ > _Click on your Application Load Balancer resource to see its domain_

   Once you have the domain name, you can point DNS record to this domain using your DNS provider:

   - Use **ALIAS** record type for root domains (i.e _mydomain.com_)
   - Use **CNAME** record type for subdomains (i.e _www.mydomain.com_ or _staging.mydomain.com_

# Configure listeners

- Listeners provide a way to expose ports of network-load-balancer. They makes network-load-balancer accessible from the
  outside.

- Listeners are listening on specified ports and forward traffic to compute resources through
  [event integrations](#integrating-with-compute-resources).

-   Listeners are used to expose specific ports of the Load balancer.
-   Traffic routed to the listener is then routed to the target resource based on the integrations.

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="NetworkLoadBalancerListener"
  searchForReferencesInDefinition="NetworkLoadBalancerProps"
/>

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'network-load-balancer'
    properties:
      customDomains:
        - my-app.mydomain.com
      # {start-highlight}
      listeners:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TLS
        - port: 8081
          protocol: TCP
        - port: 8082
          protocol: TLS
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Network load balancer with three listeners.

## Using custom TLS certificates

You can configure listener to use your custom TLS certificate. In order to do that you can:

- Set `customCertificateArns` property to make the listener use custom certificate of your choice (you can create
  certificate in [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?#/certificates/request)). In this case you also
  need to handle DNS records for your domain, i.e point correct domain name relevant for the certificate to the load
  balancer.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'network-load-balancer'
    properties:
      listeners:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TLS
          # {start-highlight}
          customCertificateArns:
            - arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:999999999999:certificate/8ab817b5-c4fa-4b1d-8b72-d6082cb40351
          # {stop-highlight}

  myWorkload:
    type: 'multi-container-workload'
    properties:
      containers:
        - name: container1
          packaging:
            type: stacktape-image-buildpack
            properties:
              entryfilePath: containers/ts-container.ts
          events:
            - type: network-load-balancer
              properties:
                loadBalancerName: myLoadBalancer
                listenerPort: 8080
                containerPort: 8080
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
