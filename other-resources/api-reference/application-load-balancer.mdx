title: "Application Load Balancer"

---

This example shows a basic application load balancer configuration.

Application Load Balancer resource

- Fully managed, Application (L7) Load balancer.
- Routes HTTP requests to other resources.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myApplicationLoadBalancer:
    type: application-load-balancer
    properties:
      # Configures accessibility of the Load balancer</sd>
      #
      # - `internet`: Load balancer is accessible from the internet
      # - `internal`: Load balancer is accessible only from within the same VPC network
      # To learn more about VPCs, refer to [Stacktape docs](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/vpcs)
      #
      # - Type: enum: [internal, internet]
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: internet
      # - Allowed values: [internal, internet]
      interface: internet
      # Configures custom domains for this Load balancer
      #
      # Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources
      # (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).
      #
      # Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:
      # - **Creates DNS records**:
      # - If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
      # - **Adds TLS certificates**
      # - If you do not specify custom `listeners` or your listeners use HTTPS, Stacktape takes care of
      # issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource.
      # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
      # - If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns` on the listener.
      #
      # > To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account.
      # > This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)
      # > (collection of records managed together for a given domain)
      # > for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it.
      # > To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](https://docs.stacktape.com/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).
      #
      # - Type: array<string>
      # - Required: false
      customDomains:
        - example-value
      # Configures custom listeners (combinations of port and protocol) for this load balancer
      #
      # - Listeners are used to expose specific ports of the Load balancer.
      # - If you do not specify any listeners, by default, two listeners are created:
      # - HTTPS listener (port 443) - all traffic is routed to this listener
      # - HTTP listener (port 80) - automatically redirects to HTTPS listener
      #
      # - Type: array<object (reference)>
      # - Required: false
      listeners:
      # Configures AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your Application Load Balancer
      #
      # - CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your Application Load Balancer at the edge - close to your users.
      # - AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
      # - The CDN is used to:
      # - reduce latency & improve load times
      # - reduce bandwidth costs
      # - reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
      # - improve security
      # - The "origin" is the resource (Application Load Balancer) to which CDN is attached.
      # CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
      # - If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache,
      # the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
      # - If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin.
      # The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.
      # - The CDN has its own URL endpoint.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      cdn:
        # Enables the CDN

        #
        # - Type: number
        # - Required: false
        listenerPort: 3000
        # Configures origin domain name used for forwarding to load balancer
        #
        # - This is only necessary if the load balancer has no `customDomains` attached and the listener uses `customCertificateArns`
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: false
        originDomainName: myOriginDomainName
        # Configures custom caching options
        #
        # - Configures the caching behavior of your edge distribution (what & when should stay in cache, and when to refetch it from the origin).
        # - When response from the origin does not contain neither `cache-control` nor `expires` headers default caching behaviour is used.
        # - Default caching behaviour depends on the type of origin the CDN is attached to:
        # - **bucket** - by default objects are cached for 6 months (or until the CDN cache is invalidated).
        # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - by default responses are not cached.

        # - Type: object

          # Disables compression of the objects served by the CDN
          #
          # - Compression is enabled by default.
          # - Compression can significantly reduce the size of the responses from the CDN.
          # In some cases, less than a quarter the size of the original. This can result in a better performance
          # and lower transfer costs.
          # - The CDN compresses objects using the `Gzip` and `Brotli` compression methods.
          # - If the viewer supports both formats, Brotli version is used.
          # - The client must indicate that it accepts compressed files using the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header.

          # > Stacktape uses pre-configured lambdas together with this trigger when using CDN with:

          # > - **web-service, http-api-gateway, application-load-balancer** - Stacktape uses this trigger with pre-configured lambda to adjust headers before sending to origin
          # - `onOriginRequest` function is triggered after CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) but before the request is send to the origin:
          # - This means that function is NOT triggered when response is found in the cache (as no request to origin needs to happen)
          # - You can modify the request before forwarding it to the origin
          # - You can return immediate response to the client(viewer) - the response will be cached same way as if it was from the origin

                #
                # - URL normalization is enabled by default.
                # - URL normalization is useful when you want to serve HTML files from the bucket
                # - When the URL normalization is enabled, the CDN is able to fetch correct HTML files
                # from the bucket even when incomplete URL is used (without the `.html` extension)
                # - This enables you to use URLs such as `<<my-domain.com>>/about` instead of urls
                # `<<my-domain.com>>/about.html` or `<<my-domain.com>>/about/index.html`
                #
