This example shows a basic efs filesystem configuration.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myEfsFilesystem:
    type: efs-filesystem
    properties:
      # Enables automatic backups for the EFS filesystem
      #
      # - Uses AWS Backup with default settings of daily backups and 35-day retention period
      # - Performs incremental backups - only changed, added, or removed files are copied after initial backup
      # - Backs up data from all storage classes (Standard, IA, Archive) without data access charges
      # - Restored data is always placed in the Standard storage class
      # - Default backup plan and vault are automatically created and managed by AWS
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      backupEnabled: true
      # Determines how throughput is managed for the filesystem
      #
      # - **elastic** (Recommended): Best for unpredictable or spiky workloads
      # - Ideal for workloads using high throughput â‰¤5% of the time
      # - Perfect for web apps, CI/CD pipelines, or occasional data analytics
      # - Automatically scales up/down based on demand
      #
      # - **provisioned**: Best for steady, predictable workloads
      # - Ideal when using high throughput >5% of the time
      # - Suitable for media streaming, production databases
      # - Requires setting `provisionedThroughputInMibps`
      #
      # - **bursting**: Scales with storage size
      # - Provides baseline of 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage
      # - Good for small dev environments and team file shares
      # - Can hit limits if burst credits are depleted
      # - Consider switching if consistently using >80% throughput
      #
      # - Type: enum: [bursting, elastic, provisioned]
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: elastic
      # - Allowed values: [bursting, elastic, provisioned]
      throughputMode: elastic
      # Specifies the desired throughput in MiB/s when using provisioned mode
      #
      # - Required when `throughputMode` is set to 'provisioned'
      # - Must be greater than 0
      # - Charged additional fees based on the provisioned throughput
      # - Can be modified at any time to adjust performance
      # - Example: 100 means 100 MiB/s of guaranteed throughput
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      provisionedThroughputInMibps: 100
