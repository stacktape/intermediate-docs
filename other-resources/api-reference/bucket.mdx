This example shows a basic bucket configuration.

Storage bucket resource

- Durable and highly-available object storage with pay-per-use pricing.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      # Allows you to upload a specified directory to the bucket on every deployment
      #
      # - After the upload is finished, your bucket will contain the contents of the local folder.
      # - Files are uploaded using parallel, multipart uploads.
      #
      # > Existing contents of the bucket will be deleted and replaced with the contents of the local directory.
      # You should not use `directoryUpload` for buckets with application-generated or user-generated content.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      directoryUpload:
        # Path to the directory that should be uploaded to the bucket
        #
        # - After the sync is finished, your bucket will contain the contents of the local folder.
        # - Path is relative to current working directory.
        #
        # > Existing contents of the bucket will be deleted and replaced with the contents of the local directory.
        # You should not use bucket with autoSync enabled for application-generated or user-generated content.
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: true
        directoryPath: ./path/to/directoryPath
        # File options allow you to set properties of files (objects) during the upload.
        #
        # - Type: array<object (reference)>
        # - Required: false
        fileOptions:
        # Configures which files should be excluded from upload (glob patterns).
        #
        # - Relative to the `directoryPath`
        # - Following example patterns might include spaces due to docs rendering issues. Remove them before using these patterns in your config:
        # - Example pattern excluding all files ending in **.js.map**: `** /*.js.map`
        # - Example pattern excluding all files in directory named **test**: `test/**`
        #
        # - Type: array<string>
        # - Required: false
        excludeFilesPatterns:
          - example-value
        # Configures HTTP headers of uploaded files to be optimized for selected preset
        #
        # Available presets:
        # - **static-website**:
        # - sets `cache-control` header value for all uploaded files to `public, max-age=0, s-maxage=31536000, must-revalidate`.
        # - this setup caches all the content on the CDN but never caches files in the browser.
        # - **gatsby-static-website**:
        # - optimized for static websites built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
        # according to [Gatsby caching recommendations](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/caching/).
        # - **single-page-app**:
        # - optimized for a [Single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
        # - `html` files are never cached (so that when you re-deploy your website, your users always get the latest content)
        # - All other assets (.js, .css, etc.) are cached indefinitely. You should **ALWAYS** add a content hash to the filename,
        # so that your users always get a new version of your website after you deploy it. To learn how to add a content hash
        # to your files, refer to the docs of your bundler, for example [webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/).
        # - You can override these presets using custom `filters`.
        # > When `headersPreset` is used, `cdn.invalidateAfterDeploy` must also be configured.
        #
        # - Type: enum: [gatsby-static-website, single-page-app, static-website]
        # - Required: false
        # - Allowed values: [gatsby-static-website, single-page-app, static-website]
        headersPreset: gatsby-static-website
        # Disables S3 transfer acceleration.
        #
        # - S3 transfer acceleration improves upload times of your directory contents.
        # - Objects are uploaded to the nearest AWS edge location, and routed to the bucket from there using AWS backbone network.
        # - Used to improve upload times and security.
        # - S3 transfer acceleration includes (insignificant) additional costs.
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: false
        # - Default: false
        disableS3TransferAcceleration: false

      accessibility:
        # Configures pre-defined accessibility modes for the bucket
        #
        # - Allows you to easily configure the most commonly used access patterns.
        # - Available modes:
        # - `public-read-write` - Everyone can read from and write to the bucket.
        # - `public-read` - Everyone can read from the bucket. Only compute resources and entities with sufficient IAM permissions can write to the bucket.
        # - `private` - (default) Only compute resources and entities with sufficient IAM permissions can read from or write to the bucket.
        # - For functions, batch jobs and container workloads, you can grant required IAM permissions to read/write from
        # the bucket using `allowsAccessTo` or `iamRoleStatements` in their configuration.
        #
        # - Type: enum: [private, public-read, public-read-write]
        # - Required: true

      # Configures CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) HTTP headers for the bucket.
      #
      # - Web browsers use CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to block the website from making requests to a different origin
      # (server) than the one the website is served from. This means that if you make a request from a website served from
      # `https://my-website.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/` to `https://my-api.my-domain.com`, the request will fail.
      #
      # - Type: object

      cors:
        # Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) HTTP headers for the bucket
        #
        # - If you enable CORS and do not specify any cors rules, default rule with following configuration is used:

        #
        # - When the bucket receives a preflight request from a browser, it evaluates the CORS configuration for the bucket and uses the first CORS rule
        # that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:
        # - The request's Origin header must match one of allowedOrigins element.

      # - Required: false
      lifecycleRules:
      # Enables sending bucket events into default EventBridge bus.
      #
      # - When enabled whenever certain actions happen in your bucket (object is created/deleted etc...), an event(notification) is sent into default event bus.
      # - To see the full list of all bucket events that are sent into the event bus refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventBridge.html)

      # Configures AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your Bucket
      #
      # - CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your bucket at the edge - close to your users.
      # - AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
      # - The CDN is used to:
      # - reduce latency & improve load times
      # - reduce bandwidth costs
      # - reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
      # - improve security
      # - The "origin" is the resource(bucket) attached to the CDN.
      # CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
      # - If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache,
      # the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
      # - If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin.
      # The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      cdn:
        # Enables the CDN
        #
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: true
        # - Default: false
        enabled: true
        # Rewrites incoming request to work for a single page application website
        #
        # The routing works in the following way:
        # - If the path does have an extension (e.g. `.css`, `.js` or `.png`),
        # the request is not rewritten and the appropriate file is returned.
        # - If the path doesn't have an extension, the request is routed to `index.html`.
        # Single page applications handle routing on the client.
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: false
        rewriteRoutesForSinglePageApp: true
        # Disables URL normalization (ability to use clean urls without the `.html` extension)
        #
        # - URL normalization is enabled by default.
        # - URL normalization is useful when you want to serve HTML files from the bucket
        # - When the URL normalization is enabled, the CDN is able to fetch correct HTML files
        # from the bucket even when incomplete URL is used (without the `.html` extension)
        # - This enables you to use URLs such as `<<my-domain.com>>/about` instead of urls
        # `<<my-domain.com>>/about.html` or `<<my-domain.com>>/about/index.html`
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: false
        # - Default: false
        disableUrlNormalization: false
        # Configures custom caching options
        #
        # - Configures the caching behavior of your edge distribution (what & when should stay in cache, and when to refetch it from the origin).
        # - When response from the origin does not contain neither `cache-control` nor `expires` headers default caching behaviour is used.
        # - Default caching behaviour depends on the type of origin the CDN is attached to:
        # - **bucket** - by default objects are cached for 6 months (or until the CDN cache is invalidated).
        # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - by default responses are not cached.
        #
        # - Type: object
        # - Required: false
        cachingOptions:
          # Only responses to the requests with these methods will be cached
          #

          # Disables compression of the objects served by the CDN
          #
          # - Compression is enabled by default.
          # - Compression can significantly reduce the size of the responses from the CDN.
          # In some cases, less than a quarter the size of the original. This can result in a better performance
          # and lower transfer costs.
          # - The CDN compresses objects using the `Gzip` and `Brotli` compression methods.
          # - If the viewer supports both formats, Brotli version is used.
          # - The client must indicate that it accepts compressed files using the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header.
          # - To learn more about compression, refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html)
          #

          # Configures HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key
          #
          # - By default the cache key depends on the type of origin the CDN routes to:
          # - **bucket** - only `url path` is part of the cache key
          # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - only `url path` and `query string` are part of the cache key

        # - **Adds TLS certificates**
        # - If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of

        # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.

                #
                # - URL normalization is enabled by default.
                # - URL normalization is useful when you want to serve HTML files from the bucket
                # - When the URL normalization is enabled, the CDN is able to fetch correct HTML files
                # from the bucket even when incomplete URL is used (without the `.html` extension)
                # - This enables you to use URLs such as `<<my-domain.com>>/about` instead of urls
                # `<<my-domain.com>>/about.html` or `<<my-domain.com>>/about/index.html`
                #
