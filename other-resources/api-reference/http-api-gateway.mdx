This example shows a basic http api gateway configuration.

HTTP Api Gateway resource

- Fully managed, serverless HTTP Api Gateway with pay-per-request pricing.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      # Determines the shape of the event delivered to your integrations.
      #
      # - Payload can be also set on the integration level (when configuring `events` for your workload).
      # This value is only used if the payload format is not set on the integration level.
      # - To understand differences between payload formats, refer to
      # [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html#http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.proxy-format)

      payloadFormat: 1.0
      # Configures CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) HTTP headers for this HTTP API Gateway.

      cors:

        #
        # If you do not specify any additional properties, default CORS configuration is used:

      # - You can browse your logs in 2 ways:
      # - go to the log group page in the AWS CloudWatch console. You can use `stacktape stack-info` command to get a
      # direct link.
      # - use [stacktape logs command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/logs/) to print logs to the console

        # Configures forwarding of logs to specified destination
        #
        # - Log forwarding is done using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) delivery stream.
        # - When using log forwarding, you will incur costs based on the amount of data being transferred to the destination (~$0.03 per transferred GB).
        # Refer to [AWS Kinesis Firehose Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3) page to see details.
        # - Currently supported destinations for logs:
        # - `http-endpoint`
        # - delivers logs to any HTTP endpoint.
        # - The endpoint must follow [Firehose request and response specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html).
        # (Many of the third party vendors are compliant with this specifications out of the box.)
        # - `datadog`
        # - delivers logs to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
        # - `highlight`
        # - delivers logs to [Highlight.io](https://www.highlight.io/) project.
        #
        # Refer to [our docs](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/log-forwarding/) for more information.
        #
        # > Logs that fail to be delivered to the destination even after multiple retries (time spend on retries can be configured) are put into bucket with name `{stackName}-{resourceName}-logs-{generatedHash}`

            # - The configured key is copied verbatim into the value of this header.The contents can be arbitrary and can potentially represent a JWT token or an ACCESS_KEY.
            # - It is recommended to use [secret](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/secrets/) for storing your access key.

      # Attaches a custom domains to this HTTP API Gateway
      #
      # Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources
      # (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).
      #
      # Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:
      # - **Creates DNS records**:
      # - If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
      # - **Adds TLS certificates**
      # - If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of
      # issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource.
      # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
      # - If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.
      #
      # > To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account.
      # > This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)
      # > (collection of records managed together for a given domain)
      # > for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it.

      customDomains:
      # Configures AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your HTTP API Gateway
      #
      # - CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your HTTP API Gateway at the edge - close to your users.
      # - AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
      # - The CDN is used to:
      # - reduce latency & improve load times
      # - reduce bandwidth costs
      # - reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
      # - improve security
      # - The "origin" is the resource (HTTP API Gateway) to which CDN is attached.
      # CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
      # - If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache,
      # the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
      # - If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin.
      # The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.

        #
        # - Configures the caching behavior of your edge distribution (what & when should stay in cache, and when to refetch it from the origin).
        # - When response from the origin does not contain neither `cache-control` nor `expires` headers default caching behaviour is used.
        # - Default caching behaviour depends on the type of origin the CDN is attached to:
        # - **bucket** - by default objects are cached for 6 months (or until the CDN cache is invalidated).
        # - **http-api-gateway** and **application-load-balancer** - by default responses are not cached.

          #
          # - Compression is enabled by default.
          # - Compression can significantly reduce the size of the responses from the CDN.
          # In some cases, less than a quarter the size of the original. This can result in a better performance
          # and lower transfer costs.
          # - The CDN compresses objects using the `Gzip` and `Brotli` compression methods.
          # - If the viewer supports both formats, Brotli version is used.
          # - The client must indicate that it accepts compressed files using the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header.

        # - **Adds TLS certificates**
        # - If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of
        # issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource.
        # This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.

        #
        # - Potential use-cases for using edge functions:
        # - generating immediate HTTP response without the need to check CDN cache or forward to the origin
        # - modifying request (i.e rewrite url, headers etc) before forwarding to the origin
        # - inspection of cookies

          # - `onOriginRequest` function is triggered after CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) but before the request is send to the origin:
          # - This means that function is NOT triggered when response is found in the cache (as no request to origin needs to happen)

## bucket

This example shows how to configure routeto using bucket.

                #
                # - URL normalization is enabled by default.
                # - URL normalization is useful when you want to serve HTML files from the bucket
                # - When the URL normalization is enabled, the CDN is able to fetch correct HTML files
                # from the bucket even when incomplete URL is used (without the `.html` extension)
                # - This enables you to use URLs such as `<<my-domain.com>>/about` instead of urls
                # `<<my-domain.com>>/about.html` or `<<my-domain.com>>/about/index.html`
                #
                # - Type: boolean
                # - Required: false
                # - Default: false
                disableUrlNormalization: false
