This example shows a basic sqs queue configuration.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  mySqsQueue:
    type: sqs-queue
    properties:
      # The amount of time each message delivery is delayed.
      #
      # - Specifies the time in seconds for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed
      # - You can specify an integer value of 0 to 900
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 0
      delayMessagesSecond: 0
      # The limit of how many bytes that a message can contain before queue rejects it
      #
      # - You can specify an integer value from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB).
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 262,144(256Kib)
      maxMessageSizeBytes: 262,144(256Kib)
      # The number of seconds that queue retains a message
      #
      # - You can specify an integer value from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days).
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 345600(4days)
      messageRetentionPeriodSeconds: 345600(4days)
      # Enables long polling for receiving messages from queue
      #
      # - You can specify the duration, in seconds, that the ReceiveMessage action call waits until a message
      # is in the queue in order to include it in the response, rather than returning an empty response
      # if a message isn't yet available. This is called long polling.
      # - In other words: sets default `WaitTimeSeconds` when consumer pulls messages from queue by calling
      # [ReceiveMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html).
      # - Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by:
      # - eliminating the number of empty responses (when there are no messages available for a ReceiveMessage request)
      # - eliminating false empty responses (when messages are available but aren't included in a response).
      # - If this value is set to 0(by default) **short polling** is used.
      # - To understand differences between short and long polling refer to
      # [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html#sqs-short-long-polling-differences)
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 0
      longPollingSeconds: 0
      # The length of time during which a message will be unavailable after a message is delivered from the queue
      #
      # - **Receiving messages explained:** When a consumer [receives and processes a message from a queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/examples-sqs-messages.html#sqs-messages-receive),
      # **the message remains in the queue**. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically delete the message.
      # Because Amazon SQS is a distributed system, there's no guarantee that the consumer
      # actually receives the message (for example, due to a connectivity issue, or due to an issue in the consumer application).
      # Thus, the consumer must delete the message from the queue after receiving and processing it.
      # - **Visibility timeout explained:** Immediately after a message is received, it remains in the queue(see above).
      # To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout,
      # a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message.
      # - For more information about visibility timeout refer to
      # [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html).
      # - Visibility timeout must be from 0 to 43,200 seconds (12 hours)
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 30
      visibilityTimeoutSeconds: 30
      # If set to true, creates a FIFO queue
      #
      # - FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues have all the capabilities of the standard queues,
      # but are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical,
      # or where duplicates can't be tolerated.
      # - For more information on FIFO queues refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html)
      # > When using FIFO, each message should contain `MessageDeduplicationId` or **contentBasedDeduplication** must be enabled.
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: false
      fifoEnabled: false
      # If set to true, enables FIFO high throughput mode
      #
      # - High throughput of queue is achieved by partitioning queue messages into multiple partitions.
      # - Partition management occurs automatically in the background and is transparent to your applications. Your queue and messages are available at all times.
      # - Partitioning of messages is based on `messageGroupId` message tag that is used for calculating
      # hashes - resulting hash determines which partition message belongs to.
      # - Messages that belong to the same message group (have same `messageGroupId`) are always processed one by one.
      # - For more information refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html)
      # > FIFO must be enabled in order to use this feature
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      fifoHighThroughput: true
      # If set to true, enables content based deduplication for FIFO queue
      #
      # - Specifies whether to enable content-based deduplication.
      # **Deduplication explained:**
      # - During the deduplication interval, queue treats messages identifies duplicates and delivers only one copy of the message
      # - Duplicate messages are recognized based on `MessageDeduplicationId`:
      # - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
      # - If you do not provide `MessageDeduplicationId`, content-based deduplication is used(if enabled) - this means Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).
      # > FIFO must be enabled in order to use this feature
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      contentBasedDeduplication: true
      # Redrive policy specifies conditions and settings for automatically moving messages that fail processing to a secondary queue.
      #
      # - Manages and handles messages that fail processing in this queue and sends them into a secondary dead-letter queue
      # - Messages are sent into a dead letter queue once the message was retried `maxReceivedCount` times.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      redrivePolicy:
        # The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the target queue.
        # - When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the target queue.
        #
        # - Type: number
        # - Required: true
        maxReceiveCount: 100
        # Name of the SQS queue in Stacktape config where failed messages will be sent
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: false
        targetSqsQueueName: myTargetSqsQueueName

        # - Required: false
