This example shows a basic deployment script configuration.

Script resource

- Executes script as a part of the deployment process
- The script is executed as a lambda function during deploy/delete operation

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myDeploymentScript:
    type: deployment-script
    properties:
      # Configures how your script code is turned into a deployment package (deployment artifact)
      #
      # - Currently supported packaging types are:
      # - `stacktape-lambda-buildpack` - Stacktape automatically builds your source code from the supplied source file path.
      # - `custom-artifact` - You provide path to your own lambda artifact. Stacktape will zip it for you if it's not zipped.
      # - Your deployment artifacts are automatically uploaded to the S3 deployment bucket.
      #
      # - Type: union (anyOf)
      # - Required: true
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: true
      packaging:
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: true
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        #
        # - Type: object
        # - Required: true
        properties:
          # Path to the entry point of your compute resource (relative to the stacktape config file)
          #
          # - Stacktape tries to bundle all your source code with its dependencies into a single file.
          # - If a certain dependency doesn't support static bundling (because it depends on binary executable, uses dynamic require() calls, etc.),
          # Stacktape will install it and copy it to the bundle
          #
          # - Type: string
          # - Required: true
          entryfilePath: ./src/index.ts
          # The handler function (method) ran when the lambda function is invoked.
          #
          # - Type: string
          # - Required: false
          handlerFunction: example-value
          # Files that should be explicitly included in the deployment package (glob pattern)
          #
          # - Example glob pattern: `images/*.jpg`
          # - The path is relative to the stacktape configuration file location or to `cwd` if configured using `--currentWorkingDirectory` command line option.
          #
          # - Type: array<string>
          # - Required: false
          includeFiles:
            - public/**/*
            - assets/*.png
          # Files that should be explicitly excluded from deployment package (glob pattern)
          #
          # Example glob pattern: `images/*.jpg`
          #
          # - Type: array<string>
          # - Required: false
          excludeFiles:
            - *.test.ts
            - node_modules/**
          # Dependencies to ignore.
          #
          # - These dependencies won't be a part of your deployment package.
          #
          # - Type: array<string>
          # - Required: false
          excludeDependencies:
            - example-value
          # Configuration of packaging properties specific to given language
          #
          # - Type: union (anyOf)
          # - Required: false
      # Runtime used for script lambda execution environment
      #
      # - Stacktape automatically detects the function's language and uses the latest runtime version associated with that language.
      # - Example: uses `nodejs22.x` for all files ending with `.js` and `.ts`.
      # - For the list of all available lambda runtimes, refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html).
      #
      # - Type: enum: [dotnet6, dotnet7, java11, java17, java8, java8.al2, nodejs18.x, nodejs20.x, nodejs22.x, provided.al2, provided.al2023, python3.10, python3.11, python3.12, python3.13, python3.8, python3.9, ruby3.2]
      # - Required: false
      # - Allowed values: [dotnet6, dotnet7, java11, java17, java8, java8.al2, nodejs18.x, nodejs20.x, nodejs22.x, provided.al2, provided.al2023, python3.10, python3.11, python3.12, python3.13, python3.8, python3.9, ruby3.2]
      runtime: dotnet6
      # Environment variables injected to the script.
      #
      # - Environment variables can be used to inject information about infrastructure (database URLS, secrets ...) into script's runtime
      # - To pass complex objects into your script use `parameters` instead
      #
      # - Type: array<object (reference)>
      # - Required: false
      environment:
        - name: NODE_ENV
          value: production
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          value: $ResourceParam(myDatabase, connectionString)
      # Parameters which will be passed to the script handler during execution
      #
      # - Parameters can be used to pass complex information to your script handler
      #
      # > You cannot pass secret values (i.e using `$Secret` directive) using parameters.
      # > To pass secret values use `environment` variables instead.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      # Amount of memory (in MB) available to the script lambda execution environment.
      #
      # - Must be between 128 MB and 10,240 MB in 1-MB increments.
      # - Amount of CPU power available to the script lambda execution environment is also set using memory property - it's proportionate to the amount of available memory.
      # - Lambda with 1797MB has a CPU power equal to 1 virtual CPU. Lambda function can have a maximum of 6 vCPUs (at 10,240 MB of RAM).
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      memory: 2048
      # Maximum amount of time (in seconds) the script is allowed to run
      #
      # Maximum allowed time is 900 seconds.
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 10
      timeout: 3600
      # Connects the lambda function that executes the script to the default VPC
      #
      # - Functions are NOT connected to the default VPC of your stack by default.
      # - To communicate with certain resources inside your VPC, you need to connect your function to the VPC.
      # Most common use-case for this is accessing a relational-database or a mongo-db-atlas-cluster that is configured to only allows connections from VPC.
      # - Connecting a function to the VPC makes it lose connection to the internet. (Outbound requests will fail).
      # To restore a connection to the internet, you would need to use NAT Gateway. We do dont recommend this, and advice you to re-architect your application instead.
      # - To learn more about VPCs, refer to [VPCs Stacktape documentation](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/vpcs).
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      joinDefaultVpc: true
      # Size of functions `/tmp` directory in MB
      #
      # - Minimum is 512
      # - Maximum is 10240
      #
      # - Type: number
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 512
      storage: 512
      # Configures access to other resources of your stack (such as databases, buckets, event-buses, etc.) and aws services
      #
      # By referencing resources (or services) in `connectTo` list, Stacktape automatically:
      # - configures correct compute resource's **IAM role permissions** if needed
      # - sets up correct **security group rules** to allow access if needed
      # - **injects relevant environment variables** containing information about resource you are connecting to into the compute resource's runtime
      # - names of environment variables use upper-snake-case and are in form `STP_[RESOURCE_NAME]_[VARIABLE_NAME]`,
      # - examples: `STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `STP_MY_EVENT_BUS_ARN`,
      # - list of injected variables for each resource type can be seen below.
      #
      #
