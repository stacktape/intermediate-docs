This example shows a basic sns topic configuration.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  mySnsTopic:
    type: sns-topic
    properties:
      # The display name to use when sending SMS messages through topic subscriptions.
      #
      # - Type: string
      # - Required: false
      smsDisplayName: mySmsDisplayName
      # If set to true, creates a FIFO topic
      #
      # - FIFO (First-In-First-Out) topics have all the capabilities of the standard topics,
      # but are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical,
      # or where duplicates can't be tolerated.
      # - For more information on FIFO topics refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html)
      # > When using FIFO, each message should contain `MessageDeduplicationId` or **contentBasedDeduplication** must be enabled.
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: false
      fifoEnabled: false
      # If set to true, enables content based deduplication for FIFO topic
      #
      # **Deduplication explained:**
      # - During the deduplication interval(five-minute), topic treats messages identifies duplicates and delivers only one copy of the message
      # - Duplicate messages are recognized based on `MessageDeduplicationId`:
      # - You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
      # - If you do not provide `MessageDeduplicationId`, content-based deduplication is used(if enabled) - this means Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).
      # > FIFO must be enabled in order to use this feature
      #
      # - Type: boolean
      # - Required: false
      contentBasedDeduplication: true
