# Overview

State machines allow you to design and automate business processes and data pipelines by composing workloads
([functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions), [batch-jobs](/compute-resources/batch-jobs)) or other AWS services
into workflows. State machines manage failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability so
developers can focus on higher-value business logic.

## When to use

- **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process** - state machines ensure that long-running, multiple ETL jobs execute in
  order and complete successfully, instead of manually orchestrating those jobs or maintaining a separate application.

- **Orchestrate microservices** - use state machines to combine multiple
  [functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) into responsive serverless applications and microservices.

# Define states

Definition of state machines is written using
[Amazon states language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html).

Amazon states language syntax allows you to to specify any workflow from easy ones to most complex ones.

The following example shows an order-payment flow made up of lambda functions:

```yml
resources:
  checkAndHoldProduct:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'check-and-hold-product.ts'

  billCustomer:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'bill-customer.ts'

  shipmentNotification:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'shipment-notification.ts'

  eshopBuyingProcessStateMachine:
    type: 'state-machine'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      definition:
        StartAt: 'checkAndHold'
        States:
          checkAndHold:
            Type: Task
            Resource: $ResourceParam('checkAndHoldProduct', 'arn')
            Next: bill
          bill:
            Type: Task
            Resource: $ResourceParam('billCustomer', 'arn')
            Next: notify
          notify:
            Type: Task
            Resource: $ResourceParam('shipmentNotification', 'arn')
            Next: succeed
          succeed:
            Type: Succeed
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Retry example

The following example shows:

- **generateReport** - batch-job which generates report.
- **uploadReport** - function that uploads generated report.
- **reportStateMachine** - state machines that ties above compute resources together.

State machine definitions provide great flexibility. In this case, **reportStateMachine** only retries upload part of
our workflow, since regenerating the report (in case of upload failure) would be costly and redundant.

```yml
resources:
  uploadReport:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'upload-report.ts'

  generateReport:
    type: 'batch-job'
    properties:
      container:
        packaging:
          type: stacktape-image-buildpack
          properties:
            entryfilePath: generate-report.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 7800

  reportStateMachine:
    type: 'state-machine'
    properties:
      definition:
        StartAt: 'generate'
        States:
          generate:
            Type: Task
            Resource: 'arn:aws:states:::batch:submitJob.sync'
            Parameters:
              JobDefinition: $ResourceParam('generateReport', 'jobDefinitionArn')
              JobName: report-job
              JobQueue: $Param('SHARED_GLOBAL', 'BatchOnDemandJobQueue::Arn')
            Next: upload
          upload:
            Type: Task
            Resource: $Param('uploadReport', 'LambdaFunction::Arn')
            Next: succeed
            # {start-highlight}
            Retry:
              - ErrorEquals:
                  - 'State.ALL'
                IntervalSeconds: 10
            # {stop-highlight}
          succeed:
            Type: Succeed
```
