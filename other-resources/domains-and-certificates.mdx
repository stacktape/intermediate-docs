# Introduction

This page introduces options for handling custom domains and TLS certificates in Stacktape.

If you do not have a custom domain and want one, read the section [Registering domain](#registering-domain).

If you already have an existing domain and you wish to use it with your app, there are two approaches:

1. **Using AWS Route53 as your DNS provider** (Recommended) - If you are using Route53 in your AWS account as a DNS
   provider, you can easily manage a domain (and its subdomains) using Stacktape. Stacktape will automatically generate
   and renew TLS certificates for your domain and will be able to assign domains to your app during deployment. Refer to
   the section [Managing domains with Stacktape](#managing-domains-with-stacktape). If you currently use 3rd party DNS
   but want to start using Route53 for your existing domain, refer to the section
   [Migrating existing domain](#migrating-existing-domain).
2. **Using 3rd party DNS provider** - If you are using 3rd party DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.) and you wish
   to keep using it, you can. This means you must manually manage DNS records (outside of Stacktape). You will also have
   to create/import a custom TLS certificate for your domain in
   [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/certificates/list). After that, you can reference this
   certificate in your Stacktape config. Refer to the section [Using 3rd party DNS](#using-3rd-party-dns).

# Managing domains with Stacktape

If you already have a domain and you are using 3rd party DNS provider (other than Route53), refer to the section
[Migrating existing domain](#migrating-existing-domain)

If you are using Route53 in your AWS account as your DNS provider, use the `stacktape domain:add` command to prepare
your domain for use with Stacktape. This command will interactively prompt you through creating TLS certificates and
optionally configuring AWS SES with your domain.

This command only needs to be run once per region per domain, and after the process is over, you will be able to use
your domain and its subdomain in your Stacktape configuration.

```bash
stacktape domain:add --region <<region>>
```

After your domain is prepared, you should get output similar to this:

```none
$ stacktape domain:add --region eu-west-1
✔ Domain name (example: mydomain.com) … stacktape.com
[SUCCESS] Loading AWS credentials done in 0.5 sec. Loaded from Stacktape API.
[SUCCESS] Loading user data done in 1.48 sec. User: Šimon Obetko. Organization: Stacktape.
[SUCCESS] Fetching domain statuses done in 4.2 sec.
[SUCCESS] Domain ownership validated successfully
[SUCCESS] Certificates for the domain stacktape.com are created.
[SUCCESS] Certificates validated successfully
[SUCCESS] Fetching email info done in 0.45 sec.
[SUCCESS] Domain is verified for using with AWS SES.
[SUCCESS] Domain "stacktape.com" is prepared to be used in region eu-west-1.
$
```

Now you can use your domain in Stacktape configuration. During deployment, stacktape will automatically assign required
certificates create DNS record which will point your chosen domain to the resource.

```yml
resources:
  apiService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: api.mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}

  web:
    type: hosting-bucket
    properties:
      uploadDirectoryPath: ./dist
      hostingContentType: single-page-app
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Migrating existing domain

If you already have a domain which is currently managed by a 3rd party DNS provider, and you wish to manage your domains
with Stacktape, you need to migrate to Route53 DNS provider. You can use `stacktape domain:add` command, to guide you
through this process.

<Warning>

If your domain is actively in use in production and you prefer hands on manual migration, you should follow this
[AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html), which will
guide you through migrating your DNS to Route53 using controlled manual process. After you migrate your domain to
Route53, refer to [Managing domains with Stacktape](#managing-domains-with-stacktape) section to finish the domain
configuration.

</Warning>

Run the `stacktape domain:add` command. Confirm the prompt for creation of hosted zone.

```bash
stacktape domain:add --region <<region>>
```

You should get output similar to this

```none
$ stacktape domain:add --region eu-west-1
✔ Domain name (example: mydomain.com) … simonobetko.net
[SUCCESS] Loading AWS credentials done in 0.7 sec. Loaded from Stacktape API.
[SUCCESS] Loading user data done in 1.98 sec. User: Šimon Obetko. Organization: Stacktape.
[SUCCESS] Fetching domain statuses done in 1.18 sec.
[INFO] To use domain simonobetko.net with Stacktape, DNS records must be in control of your AWS account.
       DNS records for domains are managed in hosted zones. (Hosted zone is a "container" for storing DNS records of your domain.)

[WARN] Currently, the domain simonobetko.net has no hosted zone created in your AWS account.
       To continue Stacktape needs to create hosted zone for your domain.
✔ Proceed with creating hosted zone for the domain simonobetko.net in your AWS account? … yes
[INFO] Hosted zone for domain simonobetko.net is created. Name servers of the AWS hosted zone are:
       - ns-1924.awsdns-48.co.uk
       - ns-290.awsdns-36.com
       - ns-913.awsdns-50.net
       - ns-1274.awsdns-31.org.

[INFO] You can finish adding your domain by:
       1. Copying DNS records from your current DNS hosting, into hosted zone created in your AWS account here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones?#ListRecordSets/Z0759875A1OGK3MWN61Y
       2. Setting name server (NS) records at your current domain registrar. Name servers should point to the name servers of the hosted zone created in your AWS account(shown above).
       After domain is migrated run stacktape domain:add again to finish preparations (creating and validating TLS certs).

```

As the command output suggest, there are two steps you need to do now:

1. Copy existing DNS records from your current DNS hosting, into hosted zone created in your AWS account (the link is
   provided in command output)
2. After you copy DNS records: Set name server (NS) records at your current domain registrar. Name servers should point
   to the name servers of the hosted zone created in your AWS account(name servers for the hosted zone are provided in
   command output). This can be usually easily done in your domain registrar's console UI.

<Info>

**Make sure to migrate all your existing DNS records into your new hosted zone before changing name server records!**

---

Note that it can take up to multiple days until the change of nameservers is propagated.

</Info>

You can confirm that the DNS is migrated by running `stacktape domain:add` command again. After confirming the creation
of TLS certificates (and optionally configuring domain to be used with AWS SES), you should get output like this:

```none
$ stacktape domain:add --region eu-west-1
✔ Domain name (example: mydomain.com) … simonobetko.net
[SUCCESS] Loading AWS credentials done in 0.5 sec. Loaded from Stacktape API.
[SUCCESS] Loading user data done in 1.48 sec. User: Šimon Obetko. Organization: Stacktape.
[SUCCESS] Fetching domain statuses done in 4.2 sec.
[SUCCESS] Domain ownership validated successfully
[SUCCESS] Certificates for the domain simonobetko.net are created.
[SUCCESS] Certificates validated successfully
[Salso allows you to configurene in 0.45 sec.
[SUCCESS] Domain is verified for using with AWS SES.
[SUCCESS] Domain "simonobetko.net" is prepared to be used in region eu-west-1.
$
```

Now you can use your domain in Stacktape configuration. During deployment, stacktape will automatically assign required
certificates create DNS record which will point your chosen domain to the resource.

```yml
resources:
  apiService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: api.mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}

  web:
    type: hosting-bucket
    properties:
      uploadDirectoryPath: ./dist
      hostingContentType: single-page-app
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}
```

{/* # Overview

Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources (Web Service, Nextjs web, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).

Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:

-   **Creates DNS records**:
    -   If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
-   **Adds TLS certificates**
    -   If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource. This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
    -   If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.

To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account. This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) (collection of records managed together for a given domain) for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it. To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

# Under the hood

For managing domains and their DNS records, Stacktape uses [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). You can also
easily buy domain through
[Route 53 AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#DomainRegistration:). SSL/TLS certificates
for domains are generated using [AWS Certificate Manager(ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)(free of
charge). */}

# Assigning custom domains to resources

To assign the domain to a supported resource, use the `customDomains` property. During the deployment, Stacktape will
create DNS record pointing to your resource/app.

To learn more, refer to the docs of these resources:

- [Web Services](/compute-resources/web-services/#custom-domain-names)
- [Hosting Buckets](/resources/hosting-buckets/#custom-domain-names)
- [HTTP Api Gateways](/resources/http-api-gateways/#custom-domain-names) (or with
  [CDN](/resources/cdns/#custom-domain-names))
- [Application Load Balancers](/resources/application-load-balancers/#custom-domain-names) (or with
  [CDN](/resources/cdns/#custom-domain-names))
- [Buckets with CDN](/resources/cdns/#custom-domain-names)

# Using subdomains

Stacktape also allows you to configure subdomains. You can connect your domain to any number of resources.

The subdomain can also be interpolated, for example based on the the specified `stage`.

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: $Format('{}.mydomain.com', $Stage())
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Registering domain

You can buy and register domain directly in your
[AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/domains/home?region=eu-west-1#/DomainSearch). Once you
have registered the domain, refer to [Managing domains with Stacktape](#managing-domains-with-stacktape) section.

# Using 3rd party DNS

You can manage your DNS records outside of Stacktape and AWS in your DNS provider of choice. However, you will need to
create/import a custom TLS certificate for your domain in
[AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/certificates/list)

After you have created/imported the certificate you can reference it using ARN in the Stacktape configuration.

Remember to disable DNS record creation, as in this setup your DNS records are not under Stacktape control.

```yml
resources:
  apiService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: mydomain.com
          disableDnsRecordCreation: true
          customCertificateArn: <<ARN_OF_YOUR_CERTIFICATE>>
      # {stop-highlight}
```

After successful deployment, in your DNS provider, point your CNAME (or ALIAS if you are using apex of a domain) DNS
record to the domain of the created resource. You can find the domain in the
[stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/):

- Navigate to **"Projects"** and select your project and stage
- Click on the resource with the domain attached and you should see the detail including `domain` parameter which is the
  domain name you are looking for
