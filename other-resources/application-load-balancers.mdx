# Overview

- Application Load balancer is an entry-point to your application. Load balancer routes traffic to your application and
  integrates easily with compute resources of your stack:
  [functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions#application-load-balancer-event),
  [batch-jobs](/compute-resources/batch-jobs#application-load-balancer-event) or
  [multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads#application-load-balancer-event).
- Application load balancers are used to communicate with your compute resources using the HTTP protocol.
- You can offload SSL/TLS (HTTPS) termination to the load-balancer instead of handling it as a part of your application.
- You can easily configure custom domain names or put CDN in front of your application-load-balancer.

# Under the hood

Application load balancer is an abstraction which under the hood uses
[AWS Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).
By default Stacktape takes care of which ports(listeners) are open on the load balancer, but you are free to configure
your own [custom listeners](#configure-custom-listeners).

# When to use

An application load balancer is a good fit for many cloud applications. Whether your backend is running on
[multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads) or
[functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) thanks to high throughput and low latency, an application load balancer
is ideal for high load fast performing applications.

## Advantages

- **Predictable pricing** - Application load balancers have a predictable pricing model which can be
  [found here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3). Even though application-load-balancers
  have fixed base price per month (as opposed to http-api-gateways, where you only pay for requests), when traffic is
  high application-load-balancer can be cheaper.
- **Scaling** - Application load balancer is designed to handle traffic as it grows and can load balance millions of
  requests/sec.
- **Health checks** - When an application load balancer is used with multi-container-workloads, the load balancer
  periodically checks the health of target containers. It only sends requests to healthy ones and automatically notifies
  multi-container-workload to replace unhealthy containers.
- **Content based routing** - If your application is composed of several individual services, application-load-balancer
  can route a request to a service based on the content of the request such as Host field, Path URL, HTTP header, HTTP
  method, Query string or Source IP address (see section
  [Integrating with compute resources](#integrating-with-compute-resources)).
- **Ease of use** - Integrate with compute resources of your stack with few lines of config
- **Security** - You can offload SSL/TLS (HTTPS) termination to the load-balancer instead of handling it as a part of
  your application. This means that any communication between load-balancer and client can be encrypted.

## Disadvantages

- Fixed price base - You are paying ~20$/month for application-load-balancer even if it is sitting idle. When you have
  low traffic application or do NOT need the [advantages](#advantages) that application-load-balancer offers, you might
  try using [http-api-gateway](/resources/http-api-gateways)

# Integrating with compute resources

By creating event integration on a workload(**multi-container-workload**, **function**, **batch-job**), you are telling
application load balancer to forward requests to the workload.

Each integration must specify:

- `loadBalancerName` (and `listenerPort` if your load balancer uses custom listeners) that will forward requests to the
  integration
- `priority`
  - priority determines order in which the integrations are evaluated by load balancer.
  - load balancer evaluates integrations from lowest value to highest value.
  - load balancer forwards the request to the **first integration whose condition** matches the request.
- **condition**
  - condition determines which requests can be forwarded to the integration.
  - condition can be composed of `path`, `queryString`, `headers` and other parts of request.

<br />

Following example shows two integrations:

- integration attached to **mySingleContainer** which forwards all requests (wildcard path `*`) to the
  multi-container-workload.
- integration attached to **myFunction** which forwards requests with URL prefixed with `/lambda-service/` to the
  function.
- since integration on **myFunction** has lower priority it is evaluated before integration on **mySingleContainer**

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'

  mySingleContainer:
    type: 'multi-container-workload'
    properties:
      containers:
        - name: myCont
          packaging:
            type: stacktape-image-buildpack
            properties:
              entryfilePath: containers/ts-container.ts
          environment:
            - name: PORT
              value: '80'
          # {start-highlight}
          events:
            - type: application-load-balancer

# Custom domain names

If you do not have a custom domain and want one, read the section
[Registering domain](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#registering-domain) on the _Domains and TLS
certificates_ page.

If you already have an existing domain and you wish to use it with your app, there are two approaches:

1. [Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs](#using-stacktape-to-manage-domain-and-certs) - you must use Route53 in
   your AWS account as your DNS.
2. [Using 3rd party DNS provider](#using-3rd-party-dns) - such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare etc. You must handle domains and
   generate certificates yourself.

For more information about domain management options, refer to
[Domains and TLS certificates](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/) page.

## Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs

Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).

Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:

-   **Creates DNS records**:
    -   If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
-   **Adds TLS certificates**
    -   If you do not specify custom `listeners` or your listeners use HTTPS, Stacktape takes care of issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource. This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
    -   If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns` on the listener.

To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account. This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) (collection of records managed together for a given domain) for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it. To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - my-app.mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Using 3rd party DNS

To use 3rd party DNS provider you must:

1. Create/import a custom TLS certificate for your domain in
   [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/certificates/list). Copy certificate ARN; you will need it in
   the next step.
2. Configure listener (more info on [listeners here](configure-custom-listeners)) on your load balancer with your custom
   certificate using the copied ARN.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      listeners:
        - port: 443
          protocol: HTTPS
          # {start-highlight}
          customCertificateArns:
            - arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:999999999999:certificate/8ab817b5-c4fa-4b1d-8b72-d6082cb40351
          # {stop-highlight}
        - port: 80
          protocol: HTTP
          defaultAction:
            type: redirect
            properties:
              statusCode: HTTP_301
              protocol: HTTPS
```

> Custom HTTPS listener with custom certificate with automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect

3. After you deploy your load balancer, you can find the domain name in
   [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/projects) in:

   _Your project and stage_ > _Click on your Application Load Balancer resource to see its domain_

   Once you have the domain name, you can point DNS record to this domain using your DNS provider:

   - Use **ALIAS** record type for root domains (i.e _mydomain.com_)
   - Use **CNAME** record type for subdomains (i.e _www.mydomain.com_ or _staging.mydomain.com_

# Configure custom listeners

- Listeners provide a way to expose ports of application-load-balancer. They makes application-load-balancer accessible
  from the outside.

- Listeners are listening on specified ports and forward traffic to compute resources through
  [event integrations](#integrating-with-compute-resources)(functions, multi-container-workloads or batch-jobs).

-   Listeners are used to expose specific ports of the Load balancer.
-   If you do not specify any listeners, by default, two listeners are created:
    -   HTTPS listener (port 443) - all traffic is routed to this listener
    -   HTTP listener (port 80) - automatically redirects to HTTPS listener

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="ApplicationLoadBalancerListener"
  searchForReferencesInDefinition="ApplicationLoadBalancerProps"

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      listeners:
        - port: 80
          protocol: HTTP
      # {stop-highlight}

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: my-lambda.js
      events:
        - type: application-load-balancer
          properties:
            loadBalancerName: myLoadBalancer
            # {start-highlight}
            # you need to specify listener port when referencing load balancer with custom listeners
            listenerPort: 80
            # {stop-highlight}
            priority: 5
            paths:
              - '*'
```

> Application load balancer with single listener and function integration.

## Using custom TLS certificates

If you are using custom listeners, you can configure listener to use your custom TLS certificate. In order to do that
you can:

- Set `customCertificateArns` property to make the listener use custom certificate of your choice (you can create
  certificate in [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?#/certificates/request)). In this case you also
  need to handle DNS records for your domain, i.e point correct domain name relevant for the certificate to the load
  balancer.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      listeners:
        - port: 443
          protocol: HTTPS
          # {start-highlight}
          customCertificateArns:
            - arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:999999999999:certificate/8ab817b5-c4fa-4b1d-8b72-d6082cb40351
          # {stop-highlight}
        - port: 80
          protocol: HTTP
          defaultAction:
            type: redirect
            properties:
              statusCode: HTTP_301
              protocol: HTTPS
```

## Default listener action

Default listener action determines what to do with a request that does not match any event integration associated with
this listener (see [Integrating with compute resources](#integrating-with-compute-resources)).

### Redirect

<PropertiesTable definitionName="LbRedirect" searchForReferencesInDefinition="ApplicationLoadBalancerProps" />

The following example shows application-load-balancer with two listeners:

- HTTPS listener at port **443**
- HTTP listener at port **80**. HTTP listener has default redirect action configured. This means that any HTTP request
  is automatically redirected to its HTTPS version.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      customDomains:
        - my-app.mydomain.com
      listeners:
        - port: 443
          protocol: HTTPS
        - port: 80
          protocol: HTTP
          # {start-highlight}
          defaultAction:
            type: redirect
            properties:
              statusCode: HTTP_301
              protocol: HTTPS
              port: 443
          # {stop-highlight}
```

# CDN

You can configure AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your **application-load-balancer**.

{/* CDN can **cache responses** from the application-load-balancer in **edge locations all around the world** and therefore:

- speed up response time to the client
- offload your application infrastructure (multi-container-workloads, functions)
- save you costs
- increase security of your environment. */}

-   CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your Application Load Balancer at the edge - close to your users.
-   AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
-   The CDN is used to:
    -   reduce latency & improve load times
    -   reduce bandwidth costs
    -   reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
    -   improve security
-   The "origin" is the resource (Application Load Balancer) to which CDN is attached. CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
-   If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache, the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
-   If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin. The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.
-   The CDN has its own URL endpoint.

For information about using CDN refer to our [CDN docs](/resources/cdns).

# Using firewall

-   You can use `web-app-firewall` to protect your resources from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
-   Web app firewall protects your application by filtering dangerous requests coming to your app. You can read more about the firewall [in our docs](/security-resources/web-app-firewalls/).

To lean more, check [web-app-firewall](/resources/web-app-firewalls/) documentation.
