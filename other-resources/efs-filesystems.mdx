# Overview

- EFS Filesystems provide simple, scalable, elastic file storage.
- They allow shared access to data using a traditional file sharing permissions model (POSIX) and hierarchical directory
  structure via the NFSv4 protocol.
- Files stored in the mounted EFS filesystem are persistent. They remain available even if the container instance is
  replaced or a Lambda function execution finishes.
- Filesystems can be attached concurrently to thousands of compute instances (like
  [Lambda Functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) and container services -
  [Web services](/compute-resources/web-services), [Worker services](/compute-resources/worker-services),
  [Private services](/compute-resources/private-services) in your stack).
- Filesystems are serverless. They grow and shrink automatically as you add and remove files, and you only pay for the
  storage used.

# Under the hood

EFS Filesystems are an abstraction of [AWS Elastic File System (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/).

# When to use

- EFS Filesystems are ideal for use cases requiring **shared file storage** accessible by multiple compute resources
  simultaneously.
- Use EFS when your applications need access to data using a **standard file system interface** (NFSv4) without needing
  code changes.
- Common use cases include: **web serving and content management**, **enterprise applications**, **media and
  entertainment workflows**, **home directories**, **database backups**, **developer tools**, **container storage**, and
  **big data analytics** requiring file system access.
- It's suitable for **general purpose workloads** needing persistent, shared file storage.

## Advantages

- **Shared Access** - Can be mounted concurrently by thousands containers/lambdas, across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Standard File System Interface** - Uses the NFSv4 protocol, allowing seamless integration with applications
  expecting a standard file system. No application rewrites needed.
- **Serverless & Elastic** - Automatically scales storage capacity up or down based on usage, eliminating the need for
  capacity planning. You pay only for what you use.
- **Highly Available & Durable** - Data is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region.
- **Performance** - Delivers low, consistent per-operation latency and high aggregate throughput (multiple GBs per
  second), especially with parallelized workloads.
- **Supports encryption** - Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

## Disadvantages

- **Latency** - While per-operation latency is low and consistent, it's generally higher than block storage like EBS due
  to its distributed nature. Overall throughput depends on I/O size and parallelism.
- **Cost** - Depending on the access patterns and storage class used, EFS can be more expensive than object storage (see
  [buckets](/other-resources/buckets/)) or block storage (EBS) for certain workloads (e.g., workloads not requiring
  shared, persistent access).
- **Not Optimal for Lowest Latency Needs** - For applications requiring the absolute lowest latency block storage for a
  single instance, EBS might be a better fit.

# Usage

Creating filesystem with default properties

```yml
resources:
  myFileSystem:
    type: efs-filesystem
```

# Mounting to resources

You can mount efs-filesystem by specifying `volumeMounts` property on the resource. Stacktape automatically takes care
of network and IAM permissions on the background.

```yml
resources:
  myEfsFilesystem:
    type: efs-filesystem

  myService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: src/server.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
      # {start-highlight}
      volumeMounts:
        - type: efs
          properties:
            efsFilesystemName: myEfsFilesystem
            mountPath: /mnt/my-mounted-system
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Mounting filesystem to web-service

You can access the mounted directory on the `mountPath` just like any other directory within your compute resource's
filesystem.

```typescript
// Simplest example: Writing and reading from the mounted volume
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

const mountPath: string = "/mnt/my-mounted-system";
const testFile: string = path.join(mountPath, "test.txt");

// Write a file
fs.writeFileSync(testFile, "Hello from EFS!");

// Read the file
const data: string = fs.readFileSync(testFile, "utf8");
// Variable 'data' now holds the content "Hello from EFS!"
```

# Throughput mode

Optionally, depending on your needs, you can set a throughput mode. Various throughput modes have various use cases, but
in general, we recommend `elastic` mode (default).

-   **elastic** (Recommended): Best for unpredictable or spiky workloads
    
    -   Ideal for workloads using high throughput â‰¤5% of the time
    -   Perfect for web apps, CI/CD pipelines, or occasional data analytics
    -   Automatically scales up/down based on demand
-   **provisioned**: Best for steady, predictable workloads
    
    -   Ideal when using high throughput >5% of the time
    -   Suitable for media streaming, production databases
    -   Requires setting `provisionedThroughputInMibps`
-   **bursting**: Scales with storage size
    
    -   Provides baseline of 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage
    -   Good for small dev environments and team file shares
    -   Can hit limits if burst credits are depleted
    -   Consider switching if consistently using >80% throughput

```yml
resources:
  myFileSystem:
    type: efs-filesystem
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      throughputMode: provisioned
      provisionedThroughputInMibps: 1000 # when setting throughput mode to 'provisioned', you must also set a throughput value
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Backup

You can optionally enable daily backup to be able to restore files in case of accidental deletion etc.

-   Uses AWS Backup with default settings of daily backups and 35-day retention period
-   Performs incremental backups - only changed, added, or removed files are copied after initial backup
-   Backs up data from all storage classes (Standard, IA, Archive) without data access charges
-   Restored data is always placed in the Standard storage class
-   Default backup plan and vault are automatically created and managed by AWS

```yml
resources:
  myFileSystem:
    type: efs-filesystem
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      backupEnabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Limit access (root directory)

You can specify root directory during mounting to limit access of the resource to the filesystem.

-   Specifies which directory in the EFS filesystem should be used as the root for this mount
-   Only this directory and its subdirectories will be accessible to the function
-   If not specified, the entire filesystem will be accessible

```yml
resources:
  myEfsFilesystem:
    type: efs-filesystem

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: lambdas/read-write-efs.ts
      joinDefaultVpc: true
      volumeMounts:
        - type: efs
          properties:
            efsFilesystemName: myEfsFilesystem
            mountPath: /mnt/my-mounted-system
            # {start-highlight}
            rootDirectory: /my/root/directory
            # {stop-highlight}
```
