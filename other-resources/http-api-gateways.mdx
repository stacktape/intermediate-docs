# Overview

- HTTP API gateways represent entry-points to your application from an outer internet. They route traffic to your
  application and integrate easily with compute resources of your stack:
  [functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions/#http-api-event),
  [batch-jobs](/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#http-api-event) or
  [multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads/#http-api-event).
- HTTP API gateways are used to communicate with your compute resources using the HTTP protocol.
- Each api gateway is secured by TLS by default.
- You can easily configure custom domain names, CORS, or put CDN in front of your gateway.

# When to use

HTTP API gateway is a great fit for any modern web app. Whether you only need "front door" to your lightweight
application or you are building powerful API backend with authorization, access control and API monitoring, HTTP API
gateway can meet your needs.

## Advantages

- **Pay-per-use** - You are NOT paying for **http-api-gateway** being deployed. You are only paying for the number of
  requests processed by the gateway. AWS charges from $0.90 to $1.00 per million requests.
- **Scaling** - Gateway scales with your needs. It can process thousands of requests per second. Moreover, rate limit
  can be increased upon request.
- **Security** - Each gateway is secured using TLS by default.
- **Availability** - Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95% for each AWS region, during any monthly billing cycle.
- **Ease of use** - Integrate with compute resources of your stack with 3 lines of config

## Disadvantages

- HTTP API gateway only supports path-based routing, i.e developers can configure which resources will receive incoming
  API requests based on the URL requested by the client. In comparison,
  [application load balancers](/resources/application-load-balancers) also support routing based on query parameters, ip
  address or HTTP headers in the request.

# Basic usage

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="HttpApiGateway"
  rewriteLinksForReferencedCompositeTypes={{
    CdnConfiguration: "#cdn"
  }}
/>

By default http-api-gateway does not need to have any properties defined.

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
```

# Integrating with compute resources

By creating event integration on a workload(**multi-container-workload**, **function**, **batch-job**), you are telling
http-api-gateway to forward requests to the workload.

Each integration must specify:

- `httpApiGatewayName` - name of the http-api-gateway that will forward requests to the integration
- `path`
  - path pattern that a request must match to be forwarded to the compute resource (wildcards and greedy paths
    possible).
  - if multiple integrations match the request, http-api-gateway **selects the most specific match**.
- `method` - method of the request (**GET**, **POST**, **DELETE**, etc.) that a request must match to be forwarded to
  the workload
- for more information see [function](/compute-resources/lambda-functions/#http-api-event) or
  [multi-container-workload](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads#http-api-event) docs.

<br />

Following example shows:

- integration attached to **mySingleContainer** which forwards all requests (greedy path `/{proxy+}` and ANY method `*`)
  to the multi-container-workload.
- integration attached to **myFunction** which forwards requests with URL path `/invoke-my-function` and method `GET` to
  the function.
- since the integration on **myFunction** is more specific than the integration on **mySingleContainer**: if a
  `GET /invoke-my-function` request comes, **myFunction** integration is proritized.

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: http-api-gateway

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'path/to/my-lambda.ts'
      # {start-highlight}
      events:
        - type: http-api-gateway
          properties:
            httpApiGatewayName: 'myHttpApi'
            path: '/invoke-my-function'
            method: 'GET'
      # {stop-highlight}

  mySingleContainer:
    type: 'multi-container-workload'
    properties:
      containers:
        - name: 'myAppContainer'
          packaging:
            type: stacktape-image-buildpack
            properties:
              entryfilePath: '_example-configs/containers/ts-container.ts'
          environment:
            - name: port
              value: 80
          # {start-highlight}
          events:
            - type: 'http-api-gateway'
              properties:
                httpApiGatewayName: 'myHttpApi'
                containerPort: 80
                path: /{proxy+} # greedy path
                method: '*'
          # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
```

# CORS

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a browser security
feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser.

A **cross-origin HTTP request** is a request that is made to a different domain or a different subdomain than the one
browser is currently on.

<br />

Example: If your website has domain **mydomain.com** and it communicates with your `http-api-gateway` which has domain
**api.mydomain.com** then the browser must perform cross origin request when communicating with this `http-api-gateway`.

<br />

There are two types of **cross-origin requests**:

1. Simple requests

   - requests that do not require CORS preflight.
   - To understand what is considered a simple request refer to
     [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Simple_requests).
   - You **do not need to configure CORS** on your gateway for these types of requests. However, responses from your
     application should still include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header where the value of the header key is set to
     `*`(any origin) or is set to the origins allowed to access that resource. Refer to
     [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Simple_requests) for more information.

2. NON-simple (preflighted) requests

   - all cross origin requests that are not considered simple are NON-simple and require
     [preflight requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests).
   - If you send NON-simple CORS requests from browser to your API, **you need to enable CORS** which takes care of
     preflight requests.

<br />

If you need to use NON-simple cross origin requests **you need to enable CORS**. CORS can be enabled with a single line.

<Warning>

If you are handling CORS within your application, it is unnecessary to enable it within configuration.

</Warning>

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      cors:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> http-api-gateway with CORS enabled

You can additionally configure CORS headers by setting properties in cors configuration.

If you do not specify any additional properties, default CORS configuration is used:

-   `AllowedMethods`: Inferred from methods used by integrations associated with the api gateway
-   `AllowedOrigins`: `*`
-   `AllowedHeaders`: `Content-Type`, `X-Amz-Date`, `Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, `X-Amz-Security-Token`, `X-Amz-User-Agent`

# Custom domain names

If you do not have a custom domain and want one, read the section
[Registering domain](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#registering-domain) on the _Domains and TLS
certificates_ page.

If you already have an existing domain and you wish to use it with your app, there are two approaches:

1. [Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs](#using-stacktape-to-manage-domain-and-certs) - you must use Route53 in
   your AWS account as your DNS.
2. [Using 3rd party DNS provider](#using-3rd-party-dns) - such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare etc. You must handle domains and
   generate certificates yourself.

For more information about domain management options, refer to
[Domains and TLS certificates](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/) page.

## Using Stacktape to manage domains and certs

Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources (Web Service, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).

Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:

-   **Creates DNS records**:
    -   If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
-   **Adds TLS certificates**
    -   If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource. This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
    -   If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.

To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account. This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) (collection of records managed together for a given domain) for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it. To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="DomainConfiguration"
  searchForReferencesInDefinition="HttpApiGateway"
  rewriteLinksForReferencedCompositeTypes={{
    CdnConfiguration: "#cdn"
  }}
/>

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: whatever.mydomain.com
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Using 3rd party DNS

To use 3rd party provider follow these steps:

1. Create/import a custom TLS certificate for your domain in
   [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home#/certificates/list). Copy certificate ARN; you will need it in
   the next step.
2. After the certificate is validated (_Issued_), assign your domain to your resource:
   - use the ARN of your certificate as customCertificateArn
   - disable DNS record creation (because you are using third party DNS)

```yml
resources:
  myWebsite:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      customDomains:
        - domainName: mydomain.com
          disableDnsRecordCreation: true
          customCertificateArn: <<ARN_OF_YOUR_CERTIFICATE>>
      # {stop-highlight}
```

3. After you deploy your API gateway, you can find the domain name in
   [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/projects) in:

   _Your project and stage_ > _Click on your API Gateway resource to see its domain_

   Once you have the domain name, you can point DNS record to this domain using your DNS provider:

   - Use **ALIAS** record type for root domains (i.e _mydomain.com_)
   - Use **CNAME** record type for subdomains (i.e _www.mydomain.com_ or _staging.mydomain.com_

# Access logs

Access logs contain basic information about requests coming to your `http-api-gateway`. They can be useful in case of
audit and are many times needed for compliance reasons.

-   Stored properties are: `requestId`, `ip`, `requestTime`, `httpMethod`, `routeKey`, `status`, `protocol` and `responseLength`.
-   You can configure log format. Supported values are `CLF`, `JSON`, `XML` and `CSV`.
-   You can browse your logs in 2 ways:
    -   go to the log group page in the AWS CloudWatch console. You can use `stacktape stack-info` command to get a direct link.
    -   use [stacktape logs command](/cli/commands/logs/) to print logs to the console

<br />

Stacktape enables access logging by default, with retention time set to 30 days.

        format: CSV
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# CDN

You can configure AWS Cloudfront CDN (Content Delivery Network) to be in front of your **http-api-gateway**.

-   CDN is a globally distributed network that can cache responses from your HTTP API Gateway at the edge - close to your users.
-   AWS Cloudfront has 205 edge locations on 6 continents.
-   The CDN is used to:
    -   reduce latency & improve load times
    -   reduce bandwidth costs
    -   reduce the amount of traffic coming to the origin
    -   improve security
-   The "origin" is the resource (HTTP API Gateway) to which CDN is attached. CDN caches responses from the origin at the edge for specified amount of time.
-   If the content requested by the client is in the CDN cache, the CDN immediately returns it to the client without making a request to the origin.
-   If the content is NOT in the cache, the CDN makes a request to the Origin. The response from the origin is then forwarded to the client, and cached at the edge.

For information about using CDN refer to our [CDN docs](/resources/cdns).
