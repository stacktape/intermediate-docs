# Overview

Event bus makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale. An event bus is fully serverless. There are no
servers to provision, patch, and manage. It automatically scales based on the number of events ingested, and you pay
only for events published into your event bus. Events can be published from your custom apps. It is also possible for
event bus to
[receive events from SaaS partner applications and services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-saas.html).

# Under the hood

Event bus is an abstraction for [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) service.

# When to use

Stacktape offers 3 types of AWS managed resources intended for messaging/communication(all use "pay per use" model and
scale automatically):

1. [AWS SNS topic](/resources/sns-topics/)
2. [AWS SQS queue](/resources/sqs-queues/)
3. [AWS EventBridge bus](/resources/event-buses/)

<br />

Depending on you use case you might choose to use:

**Use SNS topic when**

- You want to publish messages to MANY different subscribers with a single action.
- Require high throughput and reliability for publishing and delivery to consumers.
- Have many subscribers.

**Use SQS queue when**

- You are looking for reliable 1:1 asynchronous communication to decouple your applications from one another
- You want to rate limit your consumption of messages (in case of SQS consumer fetches the messages so you can control
  the rate)

**Use Event bus when**

- You want to publish messages to many subscribers, and use the event data itself to match targets interested certain
  patterns (with even bus, you can filter which messages should be delivered to the subscriber based on message content)
- You want integration with other SaaS providers such as Shopify, Datadog, Pagerduty, or others.

# Basic usage

<PropertiesTable definitionName="EventBus" />

No properties need to be specified when creating event-bus.

```yml
resources:
  myEventBus:
    type: 'event-bus'
```

# Integrating with compute resources

Events published into event-bus can easily trigger:

- batch-job - [see integration](/compute-resources/batch-jobs#event-bus-event)
- function - [see integration](/compute-resources/lambda-functions#event-bus-event)

Events can be published from any workload: [function](/compute-resources/lambda-functions),
[batch-job](/compute-resources/batch-jobs) or [multi-container-workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads)
with sufficient rights granted.

Following example shows:

- **myEventBus** - event-bus, which is used as a bridge between **myPublisherFunction** and **myConsumerBatchJob**
- **myHttpApi** - http-api-gateway, which is integrated with and triggers **myPublisherFunction**
- **myPublisherFunction** - function, which receives events (requests) from **myHttpApi** and decides whether to publish
  _BUDGET_ANALYSIS_ event to **myEventBus**
- **myConsumerBatchJob** - batch-job, which is integrated with **myEventBus** and is triggered by _BUDGET_ANALYSIS_
  event (published by **myPublisherFunction**)

```yml
variables:
  eventName: 'BUDGET_ANALYSIS'

resources:
  myEventBus:
    type: 'event-bus'

  myPublisherFunction:
    type: 'function'
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'lambdas/event-bus-publisher.ts'
      environment:
        - name: EVENT_NAME
          value: $Var().eventName
        - name: EVENT_BUS_NAME
          value: $Param('myEventBus', 'EventBus::Name')
      # {start-highlight}
      # granting access for function to publish events into myEventBus
      connectTo:
        - myEventBus
      # {stop-highlight}
      events:
        - type: http-api-gateway
          properties:
            httpApiGatewayName: 'myHttpApi'
            method: 'GET'
            path: '/budget-analysis'

  myConsumerBatchJob:
    type: batch-job
    properties:
      container:
        packaging:
          type: stacktape-image-buildpack
          properties:
            entryfilePath: 'batch-jobs/event-bus-consumer'
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 200
      # {start-highlight}
      # batch-job is triggered if myEventBus receives event that matches the specified eventPattern
      events:
        - type: event-bus
          properties:
            eventBusName: myEventBus
            eventPattern:
              detail:
                EventName:
                  - '$Var().eventName'
      # {stop-highlight}

  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
```

# Archivation

- Event buses support event archiving.
- The archive can be at any time replayed into the event-bus.
- This can be helpful when a problem occurs in the system and you want to replay events after the problem is fixed.

```yml
resources:
  myBus:
    type: event-bus
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      archivation:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="EventBusArchivation" searchForReferencesInDefinition="EventBusProps" />

# Referenceable parameters

<ReferenceableParams resource="event-bus" />
