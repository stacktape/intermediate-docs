# Overview

- CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a geographically distributed network that helps you deliver your application content
  fast and secure to the end-users across the globe.
- By distributing and caching content across 310+ globally dispersed **Points of Presence (PoPs** - also called edge
  locations) you can significantly decrease the latency of data delivery as well as reduce load on your application.
- CDN helps you improve security with automatic TLS and defends your application against DDoS attacks at no additional
  costs.

# Under the hood

Under the hood Stacktape uses [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) content delivery network spanning
across many regions around the globe. In Stacktape, CDN is always associated with some underlying resource(this resource
then becomes a default origin for CDN). See also sections [CDN explained](#cdn-explained) and
[Basic usage](#basic-usage).

# CDN explained

CDN can be seen as a layer between your application(origin) and clients connecting to the application.

- Instead of clients sending request directly to your application (**origin** - [bucket](#cdn-with-bucket),
  [http-api-gateway](#cdn-with-http-api-gateway) or [application-load-balancers](#cdn-with-application-load-balancer)),
  they send request to CDN.
- CDN delivers the request from the client to the closest CDN PoP (Point of Presence) edge location.
- CDN PoP gets a response from your application (**origin**).
- CDN PoP sends the response to the client. At the same time **it caches the response**.
- On subsequent requests from clients, CDN PoP can respond immediately using the cached response (**cache hit**).
- You can control which responses should be cached and for how long. Read section
  [Caching configuration](#cache-control) for more information.

# Basic usage

In Stacktape, you can use CDN by configuring it on the specified resource ([bucket](#cdn-with-bucket),
[http-api-gateway](#cdn-with-http-api-gateway) or [application-load-balancers](#cdn-with-application-load-balancer)).
This resource then becomes the main **origin** for the CDN, which means that the requests sent to the CDN will be
forwarded to this resource.

```yml
resources:
  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      cdn:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

You can also configure [route rewrites](#route-rewrites) to forward specified paths to other **origins** (other than the
main origin). This enables you to have **hybrid infrastructures** where some requests are routed to bucket (to get the
static content) and others are routed to http-api-gateway API (to get the dynamic content).

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnConfiguration" />

# CDN with bucket

With **bucket** you can enable CDN using two lines.

```yml
resources:
  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      cdn:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

By default, CDN caches content returned from the bucket for 6 months.

<br />

Most common use case for using CDN with a bucket is using the bucket to serve your **static website**:

- Stacktape can automatically set-up correct cache-control headers for your static content when uploading the content to
  the bucket.

- See [Cache control](#cache-control) section to understand how to control the caching behavior.

# CDN with http-api-gateway

With **http-api-gateway** you can enable CDN using two lines.

```yml
resources:
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      cdn:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

By default, **CDN does not cache any content returned from the http-api-gateway**, as it assumes that all content
returned by http-api-gateway is **dynamic**. You can control caching behavior by sending the cache control header within
response from http-api-gateway. See [Cache control](#cache-control) section for more information.

# CDN with application-load-balancer

With **http-api-gateway** you can enable CDN using two lines. If your **application-load-balancer** uses custom
**listeners** you need to specify the port of a listener to which the CDN should deliver traffic.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: application-load-balancer
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      cdn:
        enabled: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

By default, **CDN does not cache any content returned from the application-load-balancer**, as it assumes that all
content returned by application-load-balancer is **dynamic**. You can control caching behavior by sending the cache
control header within response from application-load-balancer. See [Cache control](#cache-control) section for more
information.

# Custom domain names

Stacktape allows you to connect your custom domain names to some of your resources (Web Service, Nextjs web, HTTP API Gateways, Application Load Balancers and Buckets with CDNs).

Connecting a custom domain to the resource does 2 things:

-   **Creates DNS records**:
    -   If you use your custom domain with a resource, Stacktape automatically creates a DNS record (during deploy) pointing the specified domain name to the resource.
-   **Adds TLS certificates**
    -   If the origin resource (HTTP API Gateway, Application Load Balancer or CDN) uses HTTPS protocol, Stacktape takes care of issuing and attaching correct (free, AWS-managed) certificate to the resource. This means, you do not have to deal with TLS termination as it is handled by the connected resource.
    -   If you want to use your own certificates, you can configure `customCertificateArns`.

To manage a custom domain, it first needs to be added to your AWS account. This means that a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) (collection of records managed together for a given domain) for your domain exists in your AWS account and your domain registrar's name servers are pointing to it. To learn more, refer to [Adding a domain guide](/other-resources/domains-and-certificates/#adding-domain).

        customDomains:
          - domainName: mydomain.com
        # {stop-highlight}
```

# Edge lambda functions

-   You can associate `edge-lambda-function` with CDN to be executed:
    
    -   `onRequest` - function is executed when CDN receives a request from a client(viewer) before checking CDN cache
    -   `onResponse` - function is executed before returning the response to the client(viewer)
-   Potential use-cases for using edge functions:
    
    -   generating immediate HTTP response without the need to check CDN cache or forward to the origin
    -   modifying request (i.e rewrite url, headers etc) before forwarding to the origin
    -   inspection of cookies
    -   inspection/validation of authorization headers and tokens

For more information refer to [Edge lambda functions](/compute-resources/edge-lambda-functions) page.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="EdgeFunctionsConfig" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

```yml
resources:
  # {start-highlight}

        edgeFunctions:
          onRequest: authFunction
        # {stop-highlight}
```

# Cache control

There are 2 ways to control caching behavior of the CDN:

1. By using `cache-control` header in the responses from your origins.

   - `cache-control` header is automatically detected by the CDN and the response is cached based on the directives in
     the header.
   - to see how to configure `cache-control` header, refer to respective sections for
     [bucket](#cache-control-header-with-buckets) or
     [http-api-gateway/application-load-balancer](#cache-control-header-with-http-api-gateway-application-load-balancer)
   - this approach gives you fine-grained control over caching behavior and is **recommended**.

2. By setting (`minTTL`, `maxTTL`, `defaultTTL`) in CDN caching options.
   - this approach lets you set basic caching rules, but is overall less flexible.
   - see section [CDN cache options](#cdn-caching-options)

<Warning>

Stacktape automatically invalidates cache after each successful deployment.

This means that each time you deploy, entire cache in all [CDN PoPs (edge locations)](#cdn-explained) is **flushed** and
subsequent requests to CDN will need to **re-fetch the content from the origin**.

You can disable automatic invalidation. See section [Automatic invalidation](#automatic-invalidation).

</Warning>

## Cache-Control header with buckets

You can set **cache-control** header by setting metadata on the objects uploaded to your bucket.

<br />

Stacktape can set the correct **cache-control** headers automatically when uploading objects to your bucket, if you:

- choose to upload your objects using [directory upload](/resources/buckets/#directory-upload) functionality,
- use one of the headers presets. The **header presets** are made for most common use-cases, but you are also able to
  [customize them](/resources/buckets/#adding-metadata) and set your own headers.

```yml
resources:
  myBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      directoryUpload:
        directoryPath: my-web/build
        headersPreset: static-website
      cdn:
        enabled: true
```

> Bucket with `directoryUpload` and `headersPreset`

<Divider />

## Cache-Control header with http-api-gateway/application-load-balancer

When using CDN with a **http-api-gateway** or an **application-load-balancer**, you can set **cache-control** header by
sending it with response from your application.

Consider following example:

```yml
resources:
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: hello.ts
      events:
        - type: http-api-gateway
          properties:
            httpApiGatewayName: myApiGateway
            method: GET
            path: /hello
```

> Stacktape configuration with CDN enabled **http-api-gateway** and a **function**

```ts
export default async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    statusDescription: '200 OK',
    isBase64Encoded: false,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
      // {start-highlight}
      'Cache-Control': 'max-age=30'
      // {stop-highlight}
    },
    body: 'Hello !!!'
  };
};
```

> Code of the **function** returning response that sets the **cache-control** header

Similar configuration could be done with **application-load-balancer**. Or you could swap the function for a
**multi-container-workload** since the response format is same.

<br />

To understand directives in the `cache-control` header and how to use them, refer to
[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control).

<Divider />

## CDN caching options

Caching options enable you to specify default caching behavior for your CDN.

You can specify different caching options for each [route rewrite](#route-rewrites). This gives you ability to set
different default caching options for different routes.

<br />

If you do not specify caching options, Stacktape uses default caching options (depending on the target origin):

| Origin type               | minTTL | maxTTL   | defaultTTL |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Bucket                    | 0      | 31536000 | 15768000   |
| Http Api Gateway          | 0      | 31536000 | 0          |
| Application Load Balancer | 0      | 31536000 | 0          |

<br />

In the following example:

- We are setting default TTL for the default route to 60 seconds (1 minute).
- Every request, with URL path starting with `/static` has default TTL 604800 seconds (1 week).
- If responses from origin do not contain `cache-control` header, default TTL is used.

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        cachingOptions:
          defaultTTL: 60
        # {stop-highlight}
        routeRewrites:
          - path: /static/*
            # {start-highlight}
            cachingOptions:
              defaultTTL: 604800
            # {stop-highlight}
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnCachingOptions" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

## Controlling cache key

The cache key is the unique identifier for every object in the cache. It determines whether a client request results in
a **cache hit**. A **cache hit** occurs when a client request generates the same cache key as a prior request, and the
object for that cache key is in the [CDN PoP](#cdn-explained) location's cache. If the object is in the cache and is
valid, it can be served to client without sending request to the origin.

- A cache key can be configured to include headers, cookies, or query params.
- Every part of request that is included in a cache key is automatically forwarded to the origin. If you wish to forward
  parts of request to the origin but NOT include them in the cache key, use
  [forwarding options](#cdn-forwarding-options)
- Cache key can be controlled by using `cacheKeyParameters` within caching options.

<br />

If you do not specify cache key, Stacktape uses default cache key (depending on the target origin):

| Origin type               | Parts of request included in cache key                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bucket                    | URL path                                               |
| Http Api Gateway          | URL path + all query params + **Authorization** header |
| Application Load Balancer | URL path + all query params + **Authorization** header |

<br />
<br />

**Example usage:** If your origin uses the `Accept-Language` HTTP header in client requests to return different content
based on the client’s language, you might want to include this header in the cache key.

```yml
resources:
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        cachingOptions:
          # {start-highlight}
          cacheKeyParameters:
            headers:
              whitelist:
                - Accept-Language
          # {stop-highlight}
```

> CDN with custom cache key configured: URL(default) + Accept-Language header

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnCacheKey" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

# CDN forwarding options

Forwarding options specify which parts of a request get forwarded to the origin. You can also filter which types
(methods) of requests are forwarded.

Different forwarding options can be specified for each [route rewrite](#route-rewrites).

<br />

If no forwarding options are specified, Stacktape uses default forwarding options (depending on the target origin):

| Origin type               | Parts of request forwarded to origin                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket                    | URL path                                                |
| Http Api Gateway          | URL path + all query params + all headers + all cookies |
| Application Load Balancer | URL path + all query params + all headers + all cookies |

<br />

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        forwardingOptions:
          allowedMethods:
            - 'GET'
            - 'POST'
        # {stop-highlight}
```

> CDN configured to only forward requests with methods `GET` and `POST`

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnForwardingOptions" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

# Route rewrites

Route rewrites can be used to route incoming requests to different origins: I.e., instead of forwarding a request to the
main origin (the one CDN is attached to), the request can be forwarded to some other origin
([http-api-gateway](#routing-to-http-api-gateway), [bucket](#routing-to-bucket),
[application-load-balancer](#routing-to-application-load-balancer) or a [custom origin](#routing-to-custom-origin)).

-   Each incoming request to the CDN is first evaluated against route rewrites. The requested path is compared with path pattern specified in route rewrite.
-   If the requested path matches the path pattern specified by route rewrite, the request is sent to the configured route.
-   Route rewrites are evaluated in order. The first match is where the request will be sent to.
-   If no match is found, request is sent to the default origin (the one that the CDN is attached to).

**Example use cases**:

-   Most of the content you are serving is a static content served from a bucket (static website). Some content however needs to be rendered dynamically by a lambda function. You can route paths that need to be rendered dynamically to the Lambda function.
-   You want to cache your `jpg` files longer than other files. You can create route rewrite that will catch every path ending with `jpg` and set custom caching options for these paths.

## Routing to bucket

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnBucketRoute" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

In the following example:

- we are routing all requests with url path starting with `/static` to the bucket **myBucket**.
- all other requests are routed to the http-api-gateway **myHttpApi** (default origin).

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        routeRewrites:
          - path: /static/*
            routeTo:
              type: bucket
              properties:
                bucketName: myBucket
                disableUrlNormalization: true
        # {stop-highlight}

  myBucket:
    type: 'bucket'
```

## Routing to application-load-balancer

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnLoadBalancerRoute" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

In the following example:

- we are routing all requests with url path starting with `/app2` to the application-load-balancer **myLoadBalancer**.
- all other requests are routed to the http-api-gateway **myHttpApi** (default origin).

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        routeRewrites:
          - path: /app2/*
            routeTo:
              type: 'application-load-balancer'
              properties:
                loadBalancerName: myLoadBalancer
        # {stop-highlight}

  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
```

<Divider />

## Routing to http-api-gateway

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnHttpApiGatewayRoute" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

In the following example:

- we are routing all requests with url path starting with `/app2/` to the http-api-gateway **appApiGateway**.
- all other requests are routed to the http-api-gateway **myHttpApi** (default origin).

```yml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        routeRewrites:
          - path: /app2/*
            routeTo:
              type: 'http-api-gateway'
              properties:
                httpApiGatewayName: appApiGateway
        # {stop-highlight}

  appApiGateway:
    type: 'http-api-gateway'
```

<Divider />

## Routing to custom origin

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CdnCustomDomainRoute" searchForReferencesInDefinition="CdnConfiguration" />

In the following example:

- we are routing all request with url path starting with `/external` to the custom origin
  (`my-custom-origin.example.com`).
- all other requests are routed to the application-load-balancer **myLoadBalancer**.

```yml
resources:
  myLoadBalancer:
    type: 'application-load-balancer'
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        routeRewrites:
          - path: /external/*
            routeTo:
              type: custom-origin
              properties:
                domainName: my-custom-origin.example.com
        # {stop-highlight}
```

# Automatic invalidation

By default Stacktape invalidates the CDN cache after each deploy. This means that the cache is **flushed and new
requests will result in requests to the origin**. This in turn ensures that only new content is served to the clients.

You can disable automatic invalidation by setting `invalidateAfterDeploy` to **false**.

```yml
resources:
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        invalidateAfterDeploy: false
        # {stop-highlight}
```

# Setting price class

You can set price class to reduce the costs for your CDN. Setting price class affects the number locations
([PoPs](#cdn-explained)) from which the CDN serves traffic.

-   Higher price class results in more locations that serve your traffic.
-   This can result in better performance in some regions, but is more costly.
-   Example: If your users are located only in US & Europe, you can save money by configuring `PriceClass_100`
-   To learn more about price classes, refer to [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/)

```yml
resources:
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        cloudfrontPriceClass: PriceClass_200
        # {stop-highlight}
```

# Using firewall

-   You can use `web-app-firewall` to protect your resources from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
-   Web app firewall protects your application by filtering dangerous requests coming to your app. You can read more about the firewall [in our docs](/security-resources/web-app-firewalls/).

To lean more, check [web-app-firewall](/resources/web-app-firewalls/) documentation.

```yml
resources:
  # {start-highlight}
  myFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      scope: cdn
  # {stop-highlight}
  myApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        # {start-highlight}
        useFirewall: myFirewall
