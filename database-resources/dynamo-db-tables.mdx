# Overview

- Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL key-value datastore with support for JSON documents.
- It can deliver single-digit millisecond performance at large scale.
- DynamoDB is serverless and fully managed. It's easy to set up, operate and scale. You don't have to worry about
  capacity scaling, hardware & VM provisioning, database setup, patching and more.
- It's multi-active, replicated across multiple Availability Zones, durable and secure. It also supports in-memory
  caching.
- DynamoDB doesn't have it's own query language. Instead, you can use `aws-sdk` to access the database.

# Under the hood

Dynamo DB Table is an abstraction for [Amazon Dynamo DB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) NoSQL database service.

# When to use

<NegativeMargin />

## Advantages

- **Performance at scale** - DynamoDB supports some of the worldâ€™s largest scale applications by providing consistent,
  single-digit millisecond response times at any scale. You can build applications with virtually unlimited throughput
  and storage.
- **Auto-scalable** - DynamoDb has a support for auto-scaling of both read/write capacity and storage.
- **IAM access** - You can manage the access to your DynamoDb database with AWS Identity and Access management rules.
- **Connection-less** - You don't have to worry about connection pool exhaustion.
- **Serverless** - DynamoDb supports "pay-as-you-go" pricing. If there's no database load, it's essentially free.

## Disadvantages

- **Relatively unmature** - Not as mature as relational (SQL) databases. It has a significantly less rich ecosystem.
- **Proprietary** - DynamoDb is a proprietary AWS database.
- **Not feature rich** - DynamoDb is more of a data-store, not a fully-featured database such as Postgres or MongoDb.
  For a detailed comparison (even tho arguably slightly biased), refer to
  [MongoDb comparison](https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-dynamodb).

# Basic usage

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: id
          type: string

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/lambda.ts
      environment:
        - name: TABLE_NAME
          value: $ResourceParam('myDynamoDbTable', 'name')
      connectTo:
        - myDynamoTable
```

> Lambda function connected to the DynamoDb table

```ts
import { DynamoDB } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';

const dynamoDb = new DynamoDB({});

export default async (event, context) => {
  // Put item to the table
  await dynamoDb.putItem({
    Item: { id: { S: 'my_id_1' }, writeTimestamp: { S: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() } },
    TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME
  });
  // Get item from the table
  const item = await dynamoDb.getItem({
    Key: { id: { S: 'my_id_1' } },
    TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME
  });
};
```

> Lambda function written in typescript that accesses the DynamoDb table

# Primary key

-   Primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table
-   Two different kinds of primary keys are supported:
    -   **simple primary key** - you only specify `partitionKey`
    -   **composite primary key** - you specify both `partitionKey` and `sortKey`
-   Primary key specification cannot be modified during updates (after the table is created).
-   The attribute must be top-level (not nested) field.
-   Each document saved to the table must contain the primary key attribute(s).
-   To learn more about primary keys, refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey)

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: this_attribute_will_be_partition_key
          type: string
        sortKey:
          name: this_attribute_will_be_sort_key
          type: number
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example composite primary key.

# Provisioned throughput

-   When you specify `provisionedThroughput`, the table will run in the **provisioned** mode and you need to specify read and write throughput for your table.
-   This can give you cost predictability and lower costs, but your table might not be able to handle an unpredictable load.
-   If `provisionedThroughput` is not configured, the table runs and is billed in an **on-demand** mode. This means you are only paying for what you use.
-   To learn more about differences between **provisioned** and **on-demand** modes, refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html)

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: this_attribute_will_be_id
          type: string
      # {start-highlight}
      provisionedThroughput:
        readUnits: 4
        writeUnits: 4
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Scaling

-   Even in provisioned mode, you can configure throughput scaling based on load.
-   The table throughput scales up or down once the specified thresholds are met.
-   Compared to **on-demand** mode (default, if you don't specify `provisionedThroughput`), you have more control of how your table will scale and can save costs. However, your table might not be able to scale enough for an unpredictable load.

# Point-in-time recovery

-   Point-in-time recovery enables you to restore table to any point in time during the last 35 days
-   The point-in-time recovery process always restores the data to a new table. You can restore data to the same table.
-   Enabling point-in-time recovery can result in additional charges. To learn more, refer to [AWS DynamoDB pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/#DynamoDB_detailed_feature_pricing)

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: this_attribute_will_be_id
          type: string
      # {start-highlight}
      enablePointInTimeRecovery: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Item-change streaming

- DynamoDb allows you to stream item-level modifications in the table.
- Item-change log is preserved for up to 24 hours.
- Streams can be consumed by [functions](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions/#dynamo-db-event)
  and [batch jobs](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#dynamo-db-event).
- You must configure stream type. It determines what information is written to the stream for this table when the item
  in the table is modified. Allowed values are:
  - **KEYS_ONLY** - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.
  - **NEW_IMAGE** - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written to the stream.
  - **OLD_IMAGE** - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is written to the stream.
  - **NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES** - Both the new and the old item images of the item are written to the stream.

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: this_attribute_will_be_id
          type: string
      # {start-highlight}
      streamType: NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Access control

- DynamoDb uses AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control who can access the table.
- To interact with the DynamoDb table, your resources must have the sufficient permissions. You can give these
  permissions in 2 ways:
  - listing table in `connectTo` list of your compute resource
  - configuring `iamRoleStatements` on your compute resource

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: id
          type: string

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:

      environment:
        - name: TABLE_NAME
          value: $ResourceParam('myDynamoDbTable', 'name')
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myDynamoDbTable
      # {stop-highlight}
```

```yml

      environment:
        - name: TABLE_NAME
          value: $ResourceParam('myDynamoDbTable', 'name')
      # {start-highlight}
      iamRoleStatements:
        - Resource:
            - $ResourceParam('myDynamoDbTable', 'Arn')
          Effect: 'Allow'
          Action:
            - 'dynamodb:Get*'
            - 'dynamodb:Query'
            - 'dynamodb:Scan'
            - 'dynamodb:Delete*'
            - 'dynamodb:Update*'
            - 'dynamodb:PutItem'
      # {stop-highlight}
```
