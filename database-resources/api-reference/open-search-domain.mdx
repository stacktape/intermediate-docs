This example shows a basic open search domain configuration.

OpenSearch resource

- Fully managed OpenSearch (Elastic) cluster.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myOpenSearchDomain:
    type: open-search-domain
    properties:
      # OpenSearch version
      #
      # - Explicitly specify open-search-domain version to lock it and prevent potential problems when default version changes.
      # - Currently, default version is `2.17` but this can change with later Stacktape releases.
      #
      # - Type: enum: [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.11, 2.13, 2.15, 2.17, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9]
      # - Required: false
      # - Allowed values: [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.11, 2.13, 2.15, 2.17, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9]
      version: 1.0.0
      # Configuration of cluster instances
      #
      # - Cluster config determines size, number and type of instances used in your OpenSearch domain cluster.
      # - If you do not specify `clusterConfig`, cluster will only contain single `m4.large.search` node.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      clusterConfig:
        # Data node instance type
        #
        # - Specify `instanceCount` together with `instanceType` to configure data nodes in your cluster.
        # - Data nodes handle data storage, indexing, and query processing in the cluster.
        # - For production setups, it's best to pair data nodes with dedicated master nodes to improve cluster stability.
        # - Check [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html) for the list of
        # supported instance types.
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: true
        instanceType: example-value
        # Number of data nodes in your cluster.
        #
        # - Specify `instanceCount` together with `instanceType` to configure data nodes in your cluster.
        # - Data nodes handle data storage, indexing, and query processing in the cluster.
        # - For production setups, it's best to pair data nodes with dedicated master nodes to improve cluster stability.
        #
        # - Type: number
        # - Required: true
        instanceCount: 100
        # Dedicated master node type
        #
        # - Specify `dedicatedMasterCount` together with `dedicatedMasterType` if you wish to use dedicated master nodes in your cluster.
        # - Dedicated master nodes manage cluster state and coordinate node activities but do not store data or serve queries.
        # - Dedicated masters are recommended for clusters with 3+ nodes to improve stability and prevent split-brain scenarios.
        # - Master instance type must be appropriately sized based on the number of nodes and shards in the cluster ([see AWS guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.html#dedicatedmasternodes-instance)).
        # - Number of masters should always be odd (3, 5, or 7) for quorum-based fault tolerance.
        # - Adds to cluster cost but improves reliability for larger or mission-critical setups.
        # - To check recommendations and best practices for dedicated master nodes, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.html).
        #
        # - Type: string
        # - Required: false
        dedicatedMasterType: example-value
        # Dedicated master node count
        #
        # - Specify `dedicatedMasterCount` together with `dedicatedMasterType` if you wish to use dedicated master nodes in your cluster.

        # - Required: false
        dedicatedMasterCount: 100
        # Warm node type
        #
        # - Specify `warmType` and `warmCount` properties if you wish to use UltraWarm storage instances for your cluster.
        # - Warm nodes store infrequently accessed or older data, optimizing costs for time-series or log data.
        # - Data on warm nodes remains searchable but with higher query latency compared to hot nodes.
        # - Use Case: Ideal for retaining historical data without impacting the performance of frequently accessed data.
        # - To learn more about UltraWarm storage and check prerequisites and best practices for dedicated master nodes, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ultrawarm.html).

        warmCount: 100
        # Disables Multi Availability Zone (AZ) cluster
        #
        # - By default Multi AZ awareness is enabled for any cluster with more than one node.
        # This means that OpenSearch Service allocates the nodes and replica index shards
        # across multiple AZs to prevent data loss and minimize downtime in the event of node or data center failure.
        # - Multi AZ awareness only takes effect for clusters with more than one data node.
        # - Setting `multiAzDisabled` to `true` and disabling zone awareness for your cluster is **not recommended**.
        # - To learn more about multi AZ cluster, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-multiaz.html).
        #
        # - Type: boolean
        # - Required: false
        # - Default: false
        multiAzDisabled: false
        # Enable Multi-AZ cluster with Standby
        #
        # - When enabled, this option ensures high availability and consistent performance by enforcing several best practices such as:
        # - The nodes and data copies are distributed across three AZs with one of the AZs serving only as a backup.
        # This ensures that during failure, the standby AZ can jump in without causing re-balancing and availability issues.
        # - OpenSearch version 1.3 or above
        # - Auto-Tune enabled on the domain
        # - Three dedicated master nodes and data nodes
        # - Only GP3 or SSD-backed instances and a subset of instance types are currently supported.
        # - To learn more about Multi-AZ with Standby, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-multiaz.html).

      # Storage configuration
      #
      # - Storage configuration only supported for instances supporting EBS storage (not with dedicated storage).
      # - Setting `iops` and `throughput` is only allowed for instances with `gp3` storage type (most new generation instances are `gp3`).
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      storage:
        # Storage size
        #
        # - The size (in GiB) of the EBS volume for each data node. The minimum and maximum size of an EBS volume depends on the EBS volume
        # type and the instance type to which it is attached.
        # - For more information, see [EBS volume size limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/limits.html#ebsresource)
        # in the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.

        size: 100
        # Provisioned IOPS (per data node)
        #
        # - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports.
        # - Applies only to instances with  **GP3** volume type.
        #

      userPool: example-value
      # Log collection configuration
      #
      # - Stacktape will automatically create required log groups and policies for you.
      # - You can set custom retention period for the individual log types or disable log collection completely.
      # - To learn more about log collection, see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createdomain-configure-slow-logs.html).
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      logging:
        # Error logs
        #
        # - Error logs can help with troubleshooting in many situations, including the following:
        # - Script compilation issues
        # - Invalid queries
        # - Indexing issues
        # - Snapshot failures
        # - Index State Management migration failures
        #
        # - If you enable error logs, OpenSearch Service publishes log lines of `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` to CloudWatch.
        # - OpenSearch Service also publishes several exceptions from the DEBUG level, see more [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createdomain-configure-slow-logs.html).

      # Configures the level of accessibility of the domain
      #
      # - Use `accessibility` and `accessibilityMode` properties if you wish to restrict access to the domain.
      # - By default, the domain is accessible from anywhere on the internet (but still protected using IAM).
      # - You can further restrict this access by making domain available only to resources in your stack's VPC.

        # > The reverse is also true: If you create a domain with accessibility mode `internet`,
        # > you can't later place it within a VPC. Instead, you must create a new domain and migrate your data.
        #
        # The following modes are supported:
        # - **internet** - Least restrictive mode. The domain can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.
        # - **vpc** - The domain can be accessed only from resources within your VPC. This
        # means any [function](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions) (provided it has `joinDefaultVpc` set to true),
        # [batch job](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs),
        # [container workload](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads) or container service
        # within your stack can access the cluster (if it also has required credentials).
        # - **scoping-workloads-in-vpc** - similar to **vpc** mode, but even more restrictive. In addition to being in the same VPC, the resources of your stack
        # accessing the cluster must also have sufficient security group permissions (for functions, batch jobs and container services, these permissions
        # can be granted together with IAM permissions using `connectTo` in their configuration).
