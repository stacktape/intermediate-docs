This example shows a basic dynamo db table configuration.

DynamoDb resource

- Fully managed, serverless, highly-available and massively scalable key-value datastore.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myDynamoDbTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      # Configures primary key for the table
      #
      # - Primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table
      # - Two different kinds of primary keys are supported:
      # - **simple primary key** - you only specify `partitionKey`
      # - **composite primary key** - you specify both `partitionKey` and `sortKey`
      # - Primary key specification cannot be modified during updates (after the table is created).
      # - The attribute must be top-level (not nested) field.
      # - Each document saved to the table must contain the primary key attribute(s).
      # - To learn more about primary keys, refer to
      # [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey)
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: true
      primaryKey:
        # Specifies a single top-level attribute (from schema attributes) which must be included in each table item.
        #
        # - If a table that has only `partitionKey` and no `sortKey`, no two items can have the same `partitionKey`.
        # - Internally, DynamoDB uses the `partitionKey`'s value as an input to an internal hash function. The output from
        # the hash function determines the partition (physical location) where the item is stored.
        #
        # - Type: object
        # - Required: true
        partitionKey:
          # Name of the attribute that will be used as a key
          #
          # - Type: string
          # - Required: true
          name: example-name
          # Type of the attribute that will be used as a key
          #
          # - Type: enum: [binary, number, string]
          # - Required: true
          # - Allowed values: [binary, number, string]
          type: binary
        # If specified, this attribute (chosen from schema attributes) becomes part of the composite primary key together with `partitionKey`
        #
        # - Using a `sortKey` in the primary key gives you additional flexibility when querying data.
        # - In a table that has a `partitionKey` and a `sortKey`, it's possible for two items to have the
        # same `partitionKey` value. However, those two items must have different `sortKey` values.
        # - All items with the same `partitionKey` are stored together in the same partition in sorted
        # order by `sortKey` value.
        #
        # - Type: object
        # - Required: false
        sortKey:
          # Name of the attribute that will be used as a key
          #
          # - Type: string
          # - Required: true
          name: example-name
          # Type of the attribute that will be used as a key
          #
          # - Type: enum: [binary, number, string]
          # - Required: true
          # - Allowed values: [binary, number, string]
          type: binary
      # Configures read and write throughput capabilities of the table
      #
      # - When you specify `provisionedThroughput`, the table will run in the **provisioned** mode and you need to specify read and write throughput for your table.
      # - This can give you cost predictability and lower costs, but your table might not be able to handle an unpredictable load.
      # - If `provisionedThroughput` is not configured, the table runs and is billed in an **on-demand** mode.
      # This means you are only paying for what you use.
      # - To learn more about differences between **provisioned** and **on-demand** modes, refer to
      # [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html)
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      provisionedThroughput:
        # Number of read units available every second
        #
        # - Each read unit represent either:
        # - one strongly consistent read
        # - two eventually consistent reads
        # - If exceeded, you receive a `ThrottlingException`.
        # - The above applies for an item of up to 4 KB in size. If you need to read an item that is
        # larger than 4 KB, additional read capacity units are consumed.
        #
        # - Type: number
        # - Required: true
        readUnits: 100
        # Number of write units available every second
        #
        # - One write unit represents one write per second for an item of up to 1 KB in size.
        # - If exceeded, you receive a `ThrottlingException`.
        # - If you need to write an item that is larger than 1 KB, additional write capacity units are consumed.

        writeUnits: 100
        # Auto scaling configuration for write units
        #
        # - Even in provisioned mode, you can configure throughput scaling based on load.
        # - The table throughput scales up or down once the specified thresholds are met.
        # - Compared to **on-demand** mode (default, if you don't specify `provisionedThroughput`), you have more control
        # of how your table will scale and can save costs. However, your table might not be able to scale enough for an unpredictable load.

      # - Point-in-time recovery enables you to restore table to any point in time during the last 35 days
      # - The point-in-time recovery process always restores the data to a new table. You can restore data to the same table.
      # - Enabling point-in-time recovery can result in additional charges. To learn more, refer to

      # - Stream type determines what information is written to the stream for this table when the item in the table is modified.
      # - Streams can be consumed by [functions](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions/#dynamo-db-stream-event)
      # and [batch jobs](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#dynamo-db-event).
      # - Allowed values are:
      # - **KEYS_ONLY** - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.
      # - **NEW_IMAGE** - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written to the stream.
      # - **OLD_IMAGE** - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is written to the stream.
      # - **NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES** - Both the new and the old item images of the item are written to the stream.

      # List of global secondary indexes used on this table
      #
      # - By default when querying items in Dynamo DB table, you can only query based on primary key attributes.
      # - Some applications might need to perform queries, using a variety of different attributes as query criteria.
      # To support these requirements efficiently, you can create one or more global secondary indexes.
      # - To learn more about secondary indexes refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html)
