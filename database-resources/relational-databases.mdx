title: "Relational (SQL) databases"
order: 150

# Overview

- Relational databases allow you to deploy a fully managed relational (SQL) database to your stack. You can choose from
  multiple database types, such as **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **Oracle Database** or **SQL Server**.

- They are easy to set up, operate and scale. Capacity scaling, hardware & VM provisioning, database setup, patching,
  logging, backups and more are provided out of the box.

# Under the hood

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) service to provision databases.

3 engine categories, with different topology and scaling behavior are supported:

- `Basic RDS engines`: default, cheapest, single-node database with optional read replicas for higher performance and
  Multi AZ standby instances for increased resilience and fault tolerance. Basic engines include **PostgreSQL**,
  **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **Oracle Database** or **SQL Server**. For more information refer to
  [AWS web](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/?nc=sn&loc=3&dn=1).
- `Aurora engine`: multi-node, highly available database cluster with increased durability and fault tolerance. Database
  requests are automatically balanced between available nodes resulting in higher performance. Supported engines are
  **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**. For more information refer to [AWS web](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/).
- `Aurora serverless engine`: similar to Aurora engine, but with support for automatic usage-based scaling. Your
  database compute capacity can scale up and down(within configured boundaries) depending on the load. The database can
  be completely paused after configured time of inactivity, saving you the resources and money. Supported engines are
  **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**. For more information refer to [AWS web](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/).

## Security

Databases are always deployed within stack's VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) in your private network. You can
[configure database accessibility](#accessibility), i.e whether the database is accessible from the internet or only
available to other resources in VPC.

# Basic usage

- Relational databases require an active connection. To establish a connection, you typically need connection string.
- You can use `connectTo` property on the resource which is connecting to automatically inject required variables.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('database.password')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro

  apiServer:
    type: multi-container-workload
    properties:
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 1024
      containers:
        - name: api-container
          packaging:
            type: stacktape-image-buildpack
            properties:
              entryfilePath: src/main.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Single-node Postgres database that uses RDS Engine

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pgPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING // env variable was automatically injected by Stacktape
});

const app = express();

app.get('/time', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await pgPool.query('SELECT NOW()');
  const time = result.rows[0];

  res.send(time);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.info('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

> Container workload connecting to the database

# Database credentials

- Configures credentials for the database master user.
- You should not input these directly. The recommended way is using a [secret](/resources/secrets).

```yml
resources:
  myRelationalDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      credentials:
        masterUserName: $File('.env').DB_USER_NAME # OPTIONAL
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbCredentials.password')
      # {stop-highlight}
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t2.micro
```

# Engine

Database engine determines the properties of your database, such as:

- database type (PostgreSQL, MySQL...),
- number of instances,
- high availability capabilities,
- redundancy,
- performance,
- scaling behavior,
- pricing etc.

Depending on the properties they provide, we group engine types into following groups:

- [Rds Engine](#rds-engine) group - single node fully managed databases.
  - Supported engines:
    - **postgres**
    - **mysql**
    - **mariadb**
    - **oracle-ee**
    - **oracle-se2**
    - **sqlserver-ee**
    - **sqlserver-ex**
    - **sqlserver-se**
    - **sqlserver-web**
- [Aurora Engine](#aurora-engine) group - multi node highly available cluster with replicated storage.
  - Supported engines:
    - **aurora-postgresql**
    - **aurora-mysql**
- [Aurora Serverless V2 Engine](#aurora-serverless-v2-engine) - serverless engine with replicated storage. Compute
  resources scale based on actual demand.
  - Supported engines:
    - **aurora-postgresql-serverless-v2**
    - **aurora-mysql-serverless-v2**
- [Aurora Serverless V1 Engine](#aurora-serverless-engine) - old generation serverless engine. We recommend using V2
  instead.
  - Supported engines:
    - **aurora-postgresql-serverless**
    - **aurora-mysql-serverless**

## Engine Version

Depending on the engine type, you must choose one of the available engine versions. Here is the list of available
versions.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          # {start-highlight}
          version: '16.2'
          # {stop-highlight}
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
```

### Available versions

<EngineVersionsList resourceType="rds" />

## Rds Engine

- To use the RDS engine, set the `engine.type` property to `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `oracle-ee`, `oracle-se2`,
  `sqlserver-ee`, `sqlserver-ex`, `sqlserver-se` or `sqlserver-web`.
- RDS engine is the default, cheapest, single-node, fully managed database engine.
- RdsEngine is not highly available or fault-tolerant by default. However, Stacktape allows you to configure a standby
  instance in a different AZ (Availability zone) to increase resilience or add
  [read replicas](http://localhost:8000/resources/relational-databases/#read-replicas) to increase read performance.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RdsEngine" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RelationalDatabaseProps" />

### Instance size

-   Allows you to choose the database instance size. Each instance size offers different combination of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
-   To see a list of available instances, refer to [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/)

-   Not every instance size is supported for every database engine, version or region.
-   Be aware that some instance families (such as t3 or t4) are mostly meant for testing and not production workloads
-   Refer to [AWS Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/) for detailed breakdown of supported combinations.

- Instance size can be configured for both primary instance and read replicas.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            # {start-highlight}
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
          # {stop-highlight}
```

### MultiAz mode

-   When enabled, the data is replicated to a standby instance in a different AZ (Availability Zone).
-   If the default (primary) instance fails, the failover to the standby instance in another AZ is performed.
-   The failover to the standby instance is synchronous (highly durable).
-   The standby instance can not be directly accessed (doesn't have its own database endpoint).
-   In contrast to using replicas, standby instance can fully take-over the responsibilities of the primary instance, while replicas can only be used for read operations.
-   Reduces the impact of maintenance. The maintenance is performed on the standby instance first, promotes the standby instance to a primary instance, and then performs maintenance on the old primary instance which is now a standby replica.

- Multi AZ (Availability zone) mode can be configured for both primary instances and read replicas.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t2.micro
            # {start-highlight}
            multiAz: true
            # {stop-highlight}
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RdsEnginePrimaryInstance" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RelationalDatabaseProps" />

### Read replicas

-   Read replicas help to decrease the load on the primary instance by serving a read-only database requests.
-   Replication uses database's native asynchronous replication to update the read replicas whenever there is a change to the primary instance.
-   Each read replica has its own database endpoint.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
          # {start-highlight}
          readReplicas:
            - instanceSize: db.t3.micro
            - instanceSize: db.t3.micro
          # {stop-highlight}
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RdsEngineReadReplica" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RelationalDatabaseProps" />

### Storage

-   When you run out of free database space, your storage will automatically scale up.
-   By default, scales between **20GB** and **200GB**.
-   The scaling process happens when the following conditions are met:
    -   Free available space\` is less than 10 percent of the allocated storage
    -   The low-storage condition lasts at least five minutes.
    -   At least six hours have passed since the last storage modification.
-   To learn more about storage autoscaling, refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling)

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          port: 5432
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
          # {start-highlight}
          storage:
            initialSize: 40
            maxSize: 400
          # {stop-highlight}
```

## Aurora Engine

- To use the Aurora engine, set the `engine.type` property to `aurora-postgresql` or `aurora-mysql`.
- Fully-managed, AWS-developed engine with clustering support, high-availability, increased durability & performance.
- Compute instances (nodes) run across multiple Availability Zones. Storage is automatically replicated 6-ways across 3
  availability zones.
- Automatically load-balances read operations between nodes.
- Automatic failover - if a primary instance fails, one of the read replicas is elected as a new primary instance.
- To learn more about the AuroraEngine, refer to
  [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html)

```yml
resources:
  auroraSlsPostgres:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbSecret.password')
      # {start-highlight}
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql
        properties:
          version: '16.2'

## Aurora Serverless V2 Engine

- To use the Aurora engine, set the `engine.type` property to `aurora-postgresql-serverless-v2` or
  `aurora-mysql-serverless-v2`.
- Fully-managed AWS-developed engines (based on and compatible with either PostgreSQL or MySQL) with high-availability,
  increased durability & performance.
- Similar to Aurora Engines, but automatically scales based on usage. In comparison with Serverless V1, it is more
  responsive, more granular, and less disruptive when scaling.
- Scaling is done using ACUs (Aurora Compute units). Each ACU has ~2GB of RAM and 1 virtual CPU.
- Can scale to 0 ACUs (database is paused, and you don't pay anything).
- To learn more about Aurora Engines, refer to
  [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html)

## Aurora Serverless Engine

<Warning>

We recommend using newer Aurora [Aurora Serverless V2 Engines](#aurora-serverless-v2-engine) instead of this one.

</Warning>

- To use the Aurora engine, set the `engine.type` property to `aurora-postgresql-serverless` or
  `aurora-mysql-serverless`.
- Fully-managed AWS-developed engines (based on and compatible with either PostgreSQL or MySQL) with high-availability,
  increased durability performance.
- Similar to Aurora Engines, but automatically scales based on usage.

          maxCapacity: 8
          pauseAfterSeconds: 600
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Backups

-   Databases are automatically backed up once a day.
-   Maximum retention period is `35` days.
-   You can disable automated backups by setting the value to 0 (works only for RDS engines).
-   You can also take manual backup snapshots (in the console or using the API). The retention is not applied to manual backups.
-   By default, backups are retained for 1 day.
-   To learn more about RDS engine backups, refer to [RDS engine backups AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html).
-   To learn more about Aurora engine backups, refer to [Aurora engine backups AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html).

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: my_secret_password
      engine:
        type: postgres

      # {start-highlight}
      automatedBackupRetentionDays: 5
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Logging

-   By default, logging is enabled and logs are preserved for `90` days.
-   Logged data depend on the used `engine`. You can log information about connections, disconnections, executed queries & much more.

```

## Forwarding logs

It is possible to forward logs to the third party services/databases. See page
[Forwarding logs](/configuration/log-forwarding/) for more information and examples.

# Closing zombie connections

- Connections initiated by resources that are no longer running (for example stopped containers) can result in so called
  "zombie" connections.
- Modern, cloud-native architectures usually include horizontally scalable, ephemeral (short-lived) resources. When
  using these resources, you should have a strategy of dealing with zombie connections.

## From container workloads

- For connections initiated from container workloads, you shouldn't forget to close the connection before your container
  exits. For example, ou can hook to a [sigterm signal](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads/#shutdown).

```ts
const connectionPool = createConnectionPool();

// remember to close the connection even on errors
process
  .on('uncaughtException', () => {
    connectionPool.close();
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .on('unhandledRejection', () => {
    connectionPool.close();
    process.exit(1);
  });

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  connectionPool.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

> Example of closing

## From batch jobs

- For connections initiated from batch jobs, you shouldn't forget to close the connection before your batch job finishes
  its job and your container exits.

```ts
const connectionPool = createConnectionPool();

connectionPool.connect();

// remember to close the connection even on errors
process
  .on('uncaughtException', () => {
    connectionPool.close();
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .on('unhandledRejection', () => {
    connectionPool.close();
    process.exit(1);
  });

doSomethingWithYourConnection();

connectionPool.close();
```

## From lambda functions

- For connections initiated from lambda functions, you have 2 options:

<br />

**<u>Initialize and close the connection INSIDE the function handler</u>**.

- This way you can avoid having a zombie connection.
- This approach is not optimal, because creating a database connection can be slow (can take 10s to 100s of
  milliseconds). `embed:relational-databases/lambda-connection-inside.ts`

<br />

**<u>Initialize connections OUTSIDE the function handler</u>**

- reuse it in every function invocation.
- This WILL result in zombie connections, when the container running your function stops (you can't hook to a lambda
  container `SIGTERM` signal to close it). In this case, you should do 2 things:

  - lower your database connection timeout (using a database parameter based on the database used):

    - for **Postgres**, set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to something like `30min`, `tcp_keepalives_idle` to
      `30min` and `tcp_keepalives_interval` to `1min`). This means inactive connections will be closed by the database.

  - if a database request fails because of a closed connection, you should re-create it within your application code.
```ts
import { Client } from 'pg';

const pgClient = new Client({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT
});

(async () => {
  await pgClient.connect();
})();

const handler = async (event, context) => {
  const result = await pgClient.query('SELECT NOW()');
  const time = result.rows[0];

  return { result: time };
};

export default handler;
```

# Accessibility

- You can configure which resources and hosts can access your cluster.
- To access your database, you always need to use your database user credentials.
- On top of that, Stacktape allows your to restrict the accessibility of your database to only certain resources or
  hosts.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="DatabaseAccessibility" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RelationalDatabaseProps" />

## Internet mode

- Default mode.
- Least restrictive. The database can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.

## VPC mode

- The database can be accessed only from resources within the [default VPC](/user-guides/vpcs/#default-vpc).
- Any [function](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) (provided it has `joinDefaultVpc` set to true),
  [batch job](/compute-resources/batch-jobs) or [container workload](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads) or
  services within your stack can access the database.
- Additionally, IP addresses configured in `whitelistedIps` can also access the database (even from the internet). To
  disable this behavior, and enforce database isolation ONLY to the VPC, you can set the `forceDisablePublicIp`
  property.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          instances:
            - instanceSize: db.t3.medium
          port: 5432
      # {start-highlight}
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: vpc
      # {stop-highlight}

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/function.ts
      joinDefaultVpc: true
```

## Scoping workloads in VPC mode

- Similar to **vpc** mode, but even more restrictive. In addition to resource being in the VPC, any host or resource
  trying to access your cluster must explicitly include the database in its `connectTo` list.
- Additionally, IP addresses configured in `whitelistedIps` can also access the database (even from the internet). To
  disable this behavior, and enforce database isolation, you can set the `forceDisablePublicIp` property.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          instances:
            - instanceSize: db.t3.medium
          port: 5432
      # {start-highlight}
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: scoping-workloads-in-vpc
      # {stop-highlight}
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/function.ts
      joinDefaultVpc: true
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Whitelisted IPs only mode

- The database can only be accessed from an IP addresses and CIDR blocks listed in the `whitelistedIps` list.

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbPassword')
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          instances:
            - instanceSize: db.t3.medium
          port: 5432
      # {start-highlight}
      accessibility:

# Maintenance window

-   The maintenance window is the time period during which the database is available for maintenance.
-   During this time, your database instance can be updated with modifications like OS patching or database engine version upgrades.
-   The database might be unavailable for a short period of time during maintenance. To avoid service interruptions, you should use `multiAz` deployment for RDS engines or use an Aurora engine.
-   The maintenance window is **specified in UTC**.
-   The maintenance window is specified in the format of `day:time-day:time`. Example: `Sun:02:00-Sun:04:00`
-   By default, the maintenance window is set to **Sunday 02:00 - Sunday 04:00** adjusted to the region's timezone (but does not account for daylight savings time). Examples:
    -   In **us-east-1** the maintenance window is set to **Sunday 07:00 - Sunday 09:00 UTC** which translates to **Sunday 02:00 - Sunday 04:00** in the region's timezone
    -   In **eu-west-1** the maintenance window is set to **Sunday 01:00 - Sunday 03:00 UTC** which translates to **Sunday 02:00 - Sunday 04:00** in the region's timezone

# Pricing

Pricing heavily depends on the engine used.

<br />

**RDS engines:**

- Database server instance
  - Price depends on the instance size and region. Allowed instances depend on the database type.
    [Postgres instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/pricing/)
    [MySQL instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/pricing/),
    [Maria db instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/pricing/),
    [Oracle db](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/pricing/),
    [SQL server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/pricing/).
- Storage
  - $0.115 - $0.238 per GB-month
- Backups:
  - For automated backups with default retention setting (where you never store more than 100% of your total database
    storage), there is no additional charge.
  - Additional backup storage is $0.095 per GB-month.

**Aurora engines:**

- Database server instance
  - Price depends on the instance sizes and region. To see exact prices, refer to
    [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing/)
  - Price starts at $0.073 / hour.
- Storage
  - $0.10 - $0.19 per GB-month
- I/O Rate
  - $0.20 - $0.28 per 1 million read/write operations
- Backups
  - For automated backups with default retention setting (where you never store more than 100% of your total database
    storage), there is no additional charge.
  - Additional backup storage is $0.021 - $0.037 per GB-month.

**Aurora serverless:**

- ACUs (Aurora capacity units)
  - Each capacity unit has ~2GB of memory, ~1 Virtual CPU and corresponding network capabilities
  - 1 ACU costs $0.06 - $0.10 (depending on region)
  - Aurora Serverless databases can scale to 0 ACUs (with no costs)
- Storage, I/O Rate and Backups cost the same amount as Aurora non-serverless.

<br />

**Data transfer charges** (same for all engines).

- IN transfer: free
- OUT to VPC (subnet in the same Availability zone): free
- OUT to VPC (subnet in different Availability zone): $0.01 per GB ($0.02, because you are paying on both sides)
- OUT to Internet: first 1 GB free, then $0.09 -$0.15 per GB

<br />

**FREE TIER** (eligible for first 12 months)

- 750 Hours per month of db.t2.micro database usage (applicable DB engines)
- 20 GB of General Purpose (SSD) database storage \
- 20 GB of storage for database backups and DB Snapshots
