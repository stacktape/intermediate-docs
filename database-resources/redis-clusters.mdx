# Overview

- Redis cluster allows you to deploy fully managed Redis database cluster. You don't have to worry about capacity
  scaling, hardware & VM provisioning, cluster setup, patching or backups.

- Redis is a fast, NoSQL in-memory data store that can provide sub-millisecond latency.

- Clusters are easy to set up, built on open-source Redis and compatible with the Redis APIs - ElastiCache for Redis
  works with your Redis clients and uses the open Redis data format to store your data.

- It is often used as a cache to offload main database systems.

# Under the hood

Redis clusters are fully managed (powered by [Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/)).

Multiple topologies are possible for the deployment: from a one node database, to a multi-node sharded cluster. See
section [Cluster topology](#cluster-topology) for more info.

# When to use

Redis is used in cases when the performance is important. Example use-cases include caching, chat apps, messaging,
queues, real-time analytics, etc.

## Advantages

- **Performance** - Redis is an in-memory data store and can deliver sub-millisecond response times. In comparison to
  disk-based databases (where most operations need a roundtrip to a disk), in-memory data stores can be an order of
  magnitude faster.
- **Fully managed** - You don't have to worry about capacity scaling, hardware & VM provisioning, cluster setup,
  sharding process, patching, backups, etc.
- **High availability** - Redis supports both clustered and non-clustered modes and provides high availability via
  support for automatic failovers with minimal impact.

## Disadvantages

- **Data persistence** - Redis offers 2 options for persistency: regular snap-shotting and append-only files. None of
  them is as secure as a real transactional server providing undo/redo logging, point-in-time recovery, etc.
- **Hard to store large amounts of data** - All your data must fit in memory.
- **Requires topology-aware clients** - Clients connecting to the Redis cluster should be aware of the cluster topology.
  This requires more configuration on the client.

# Basic usage

- Following example shows basic usage of `redis-cluster` resource. Only required properties are **instanceSize** and
  **defaultUserPassword**.
- The example shows a single node `redis-cluster`.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/lambda.ts
      joinDefaultVpc: true
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myRedisCluster
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Lambda function connected to a single-node redis cluster

```ts
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

const redisClient = new Redis(process.env.STP_MY_REDIS_CLUSTER_CONNECTION_STRING);

const handler = async (event, context) => {
  await redisClient.set('currentTime', `${Date.now()}`);

  const value = await redisClient.get('currentTime');

  return { result: value };
};

export default handler;
```

# Node instance size

-   Different instance sizes have different memory and network capabilities.
-   Instance size can be changed without interrupting the cluster or losing the data.
-   To learn more, and see a detailed list of available instances, refer to [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/)

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      # {stop-highlight}
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
```

# Default user password

-   Redis clusters are password protected. To communicate with the cluster, you must configure a password for the default user.
-   Communication with the cluster is encrypted in-transit.
-   You should not input the password directly. The recommended way is using [secrets](/resources/secrets/).
-   Password constraints:
    -   Must be only printable ASCII characters.
    -   Must be at least 16 characters and no more than 128 characters in length.
    -   Cannot contain any of the following characters: '/', '"', or '@'.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      # {stop-highlight}
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
```

# Cluster topology

- Cluster topology is based on the amount of replica nodes and the amount of shards.
- Performance and high-availability of the cluster are dependent on the topology.

## Single node (non-sharded) cluster

- Single node, non-sharded cluster has only one node. It's not highly available.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
```

## Multi node (non-sharded) cluster

-   Adding replica nodes (read replicas) to a cluster has 2 benefits:
    -   increases the read throughput
    -   increases availability. Replica node can become the primary node in case of primary node failure.
-   Load balancing between replicas is automatically handled by AWS.
-   When there are multiple shards, this number specifies the number of replicas for each **shard cluster**.

Changing `numReplicaNodes` when sharding is enabled is not possible and will result in error.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
      numReplicaNodes: 2
```

## Sharded cluster

-   Sharding enables you to scale redis cluster horizontally, by splitting the data into shards.
-   Each shard is then served by a **shard cluster**, which is responsible for given shard. Each **shard cluster** has a primary instance and `numReplicaNodes` amount of replicas.
-   You can update (increase or decrease) number of shards without interrupting the cluster.
-   You cannot update number of replicas per shard cluster on sharded cluster.
-   Routing to correct shard and shard re-balancing is automatically handled by AWS.
-   To learn more about sharding, refer to [AWS Docs](/resources/redis-clusters/#sharded-cluster).

Sharding comes with multiple limitations:

-   Sharding can only be enabled during redis cluster initial creation. After that the cluster cannot be updated from non-sharded to sharded or vice-versa.
-   Changing `numReplicaNodes` when sharding is enabled is not possible. In this case it is necessary to delete and recreate the cluster.
-   `numReplicaNodes` must be set to at least `1` when sharding is enabled.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
      # {start-highlight}
      enableSharding: true
      numShards: 2
      # {stop-highlight}
      numReplicaNodes: 2
```

![Sharded cluster topology](../static/redis-clusters/sharded-redis.png)

```ts
import { Cluster } from 'ioredis';

const redisClusterClient = new Cluster(
  [
    {
      host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
      port: Number(process.env.REDIS_PORT)
    }
  ],
  {
    redisOptions: { tls: {}, password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD },
    dnsLookup: (address, callback) => callback(null, address)
  }
);

const handler = async (event, context) => {
  await redisClusterClient.set('currentTime', `${Date.now()}`);

  const value = await redisClusterClient.get('currentTime');

  return { result: value };
};

export default handler;
```

# Logging

- When logging is enabled, [slow-log](https://redis.io/commands/slowlog) will be sent to a pre-created Cloudwatch log
  group.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
      # {start-highlight}
      logging:
        format: json
      # {stop-highlight}
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RedisLogging" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RedisClusterProps" />

## Forwarding logs

It is possible to forward logs to the third party services/databases. See page
[Forwarding logs](/configuration/log-forwarding/) for more information and examples.

# Accessibility

- You can configure which resources and hosts can access your cluster.
- Redis clusters do not support public IP addresses. Therefore, only 2 access modes are supported.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RedisAccessibility" searchForReferencesInDefinition="RedisClusterProps" />

## VPC mode

- The cluster can be accessed only from resources within the [default VPC](/user-guides/vpcs/#default-vpc).
- Any [function](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) (provided it has `joinDefaultVpc` set to true),
  [batch job](/compute-resources/batch-jobs) or [container workload](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads) or
  service within your stack can access the cluster.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
      # {start-highlight}
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: vpc
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Scoping workloads in VPC mode

- Similar to **vpc** mode, but even more restrictive. In addition to resource being in the VPC, any host or resource
  trying to access your cluster must explicitly include the cluster in its `connectTo` list.

```yml
resources:
  myRedisCluster:
    type: redis-cluster
    properties:
      instanceSize: cache.t3.micro
      defaultUserPassword: $Secret('redis.password')
      # {start-highlight}
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: scoping-workloads-in-vpc
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Referenceable parameters

<ReferenceableParams resource="redis-cluster" />

# Pricing

You are charged for:

- **Computing nodes, shards and replica nodes**:
  - Price depends on the instance size, number of shards and number of replica nodes.
  - Can be calculated as **number of shards** \* (**number of replica nodes** + 1 (there is always primary)) \* **price
    for node instance**
  - EXAMPLE 1: Cheapest non-sharded cluster using `cache.t3.micro` instance with 0 replicaNodes: 1 \* (0+1) \* $0.017 =
    **$0.017/hour** (~$12.50/month)
  - EXAMPLE 2: Sharded cluster with 2 shards using `cache.t3.micro` and 1 replicaNode: 2 \* (1+1) \* $0.017 = **$0.068
    per hour** (~$49/month)
- **Data transfer**:
  - In most cases there should be no additional cost.
- **Backups**:
  - If retained for at most 1 day: free
  - $0.085/GB/month after that

<br />

**Free Tier** (eligible for first 12 months)

- Includes 750 hours of `t2.micro` instances (`t3.micro` for the regions in which `t2.micro` is not available) each
  month.
