# Introduction

Stacktape uses _Cloudformation_ to deploy your infrastructure into AWS. Each Stacktape resource definition (specified in
the `resources` section) translates into multiple low-level AWS Cloudformation resource definitions. Overrides allow you
to set or override the properties of these low-level Cloudformation resource definitions.

<Info>
  You can see what Cloudformation resources your Stacktape resource translates into in the config editor or on the
  overview page of your deployed stack (project stage).

# Usage

Let's say we want to override the timeout of the AWS Lambda resource which is part of `myFunction` Stacktape resource in
the following configuration:

```yml
resources:
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/lambda.ts
```

<br />

In the interactive config editor, you can see the translated Cloudformation template for this config. You can see that
`myFunction` resource contains 2 Cloudformation resources: **MyFunctionFunction** (_AWS::Lambda::Function_) and
**MyFunctionLogGroup** (_AWS::Logs::LogGroup_).

Since we are looking to override the timeout, we will specify override for **MyFunctionFunction** resource

```yml
resources:
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/lambda.ts
    # {start-highlight}
    overrides:
      MyFunctionFunction:
        Timeout: 15
    # {stop-highlight}
```
