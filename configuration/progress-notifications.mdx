# Introduction

- Progress notifications send information about relevant actions that Stacktape performs to a specified destination
  (e.g. Slack).
- By default, notifications are sent for `deploy` and `delete` commands.
- You get notified when:
  - the operation successfully starts
  - the operation successfully finishes
  - an error occurs

# Slack notification

For Slack notification, you need to configure 2 things:

- `accessToken` (Bot User OAuth Token) - You can get it by following first 2 steps in
  [this Slack guide](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/getting-started).
- `conversationId` - Can be either **channel ID**, **DM ID**, **MPDM ID** or a **group ID**. If you simply want to post
  the notification to a channel, navigate to the channel and click on the channel name. The conversation id is at the
  bottom of the **About** tab.

```yml
progressNotifications:
  - type: slack
    properties:
      conversationId: C#######
      accessToken: xoxb-####################
```

# Microsoft Teams notification

For MS Teams notification, you need to configure only one thing:

- `webhookUrl` - This is the URL that allows Stacktape to send a notification to the channel it's associated with. You
  can get it by following
  [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#create-incoming-webhook-1).

```yml
progressNotifications:
  - type: ms-teams
    properties:
      webhookUrl: C#######
```
