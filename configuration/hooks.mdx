# Introduction

- Hooks allow you to execute a custom command or script before or after specified command is executed.
- Example use cases:
  - build, validate or lint your application before deployment
  - run unit tests on your application before deployment
  - execute database migration after deployment
  - cleanup database before delete

# Usage

Within hook, you can reference scripts specified in [scripts](/configuration/scripts/) section of your config.

Scripts can be referenced in a hook, but they can also be executed manually. Refer to
[scripts docs](/configuration/scripts/) to learn more.

<Info>

During execution the script will get the following environment variables:

- `STP_HOOK_TYPE` - `before` or `after`
- `STP_COMMAND` - Stacktape command used

This is in addition to the environment variables specified on the script definition and the environment variables
injected when using [connectTo](/configuration/scripts/#connecting-to-resources).

```yaml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  buildWeb:
    # {stop-highlight}
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommand: npx gatsby build

hooks:
  beforeDeploy:
    # {start-highlight}
    - scriptName: buildWeb
    # {stop-highlight}
```

## Before command hooks

- Executed before the command, but AFTER the configuration has been successfully loaded.

<Warning>
  Executed only if the configuration was successfully loaded and hooks have been registered. The hook won't be executed
  if there's an error with your CLI arguments or in your configuration.
</Warning>

## After command hooks

- Executed after the command has successfully finished.
- Most common use case for using after deploy hooks is migration/seeding of the database, or API/endpoint testing.

```yml
scripts:
  migrateDb:
    type: local-script-with-bastion-tunneling
    properties:
      executeScript: migrate.ts
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase

# {start-highlight}
hooks:
  afterDeploy:
    - scriptName: migrateDb
# {stop-highlight}

resources:
  myBastion:
    type: bastion

  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      # database is only accessible from withing VPC
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: vpc
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: my_secret_pass
```
