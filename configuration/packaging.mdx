# Packaging Lambda functions

## Stacktape-lambda-buildpack

- Built-in, zero-config, heavily optimized buildpack that creates a lambda artifact from an entryfile path
- Currently supported languages are: [Javascript](#javascript-and-typescript), [Typescript](#javascript-and-typescript),
  [Python](#python), [Java](#java) and [Go](#go).
- Your deployment packages are cached. Stacktape creates a digest (checksum) from all the necessary files (and your
  package manager lockfiles). If a workload with the same digest is already deployed, the packaging and deployment is
  skipped.
- Lambda function packages are zipped and uploaded to a pre-created S3 bucket.
- The upload uses S3 transfer acceleration - upload is done to the nearest AWS's edge location, and then routed to the
  bucket using an Amazon backbone network. This is faster and more secure, but incurs additional transfer costs ($0.04
  per GB). To disable this behavior, set `(config).deploymentConfig.useS3TransferAcceleration` to `false`.

```yml
resources:
  myLambda:
    type: function
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my-lambda.ts
      # {stop-highlight}
      timeout: 10
      memory: 2048
```

> Example function using `stacktape-lambda-buildpack` packaging

### Javascript and Typescript

- Your source code is built into a single file with all of its external dependencies. This ensures you are shipping only
  the minimum required code. Behind the scenes, Stacktape uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).
- Source-maps are automatically generated and includes in your deployment package. The generated code also includes the
  [source map support library](https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support) to make them usable.
- If your dependency uses dynamic `require()` and can't be statically built, it will be copied as-is instead.
- If your dependency is dependent on a binary file, the dependency will be installed in a Docker container (based on the
  runtime used) and copied to the deployment package. This ensures your binary dependencies are usable even when
  deploying from a different OS (Windows or Mac).

### Python

- Your source code is packed into into a zip archive with all its defined dependencies using docker, so you don't need
  to have python installed for deployment.
- Supported versions are `3.7`, `3.8` and `3.9` (default).
- Installing dependencies is supported using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/),
  [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
- If your source code dependencies are defined in non-standard file located outside root folder, you can specify it
  using `packageManagerFile` and `packageManager` in `languageSpecificProperties`.

### Java

- Your source code is packed into into a zip archive with all its defined dependencies using docker, so you don't need
  to have java installed for deployment.
- Supported versions are `8`, `11` (default).
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (default) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) projects are supported.
- If your project uses **Maven**, configure `useMaven` property in the `languageSpecificProperties` configuration.
  Stacktape will.
  [convert your maven project to a gradle project](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/migrating_from_maven.html)
  and build it as a gradle project (which is 2-10x times faster than maven).

### Go

- Your source code is packed into into a zip archive with all its defined dependencies using docker, so you don't need
  to have go installed for deployment.

## Custom-artifact

- You supply a path to your own, pre-created artifact.
- If the specified path is a directory or an un-zipped file, Stacktape will zip it.
- The zipped lambda package is then uploaded to a pre-created S3 bucket using S3 transfer acceleration.

## Stacktape-image-buildpack

- Built-in, zero-config, heavily optimized buildpack that creates a runnable container image from your source-code.
- Currently supported languages are: `Javascript`, `Typescript`, `Python`, `Java` and `Go`.
- The image is uploaded to a pre-created (AWS ECR) container registry.

### Javascript and Typescript

- Your source code is built into a single file with all of its external dependencies. This ensures you are shipping only
  the minimum required code. Behind the scenes, Stacktape uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

  [source map support library](https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support) to make them usable.
- If your dependency uses dynamic `require()` and can't be statically built, it will be copied as-is instead.
- If your dependency is dependent on a binary file, the dependency will be installed in a Docker container using a
  Docker [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).
- The base image used is the latest LTS version of node.js.
  - `node:18-alpine` in case your app doesn't require [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)-based binaries.
  - `node:18` in case it does.

### Python

- If your source code dependencies are defined in non-standard file located outside root folder, you can specify it
  using `packageManagerFile` and `packageManager` in `languageSpecificProperties`
- Base image used:
  - `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:${pythonVersion}-alpine` in case your app doesn't require
    [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)-based binaries.
  - `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:${pythonVersion}` in case it does.

### Java

    [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)-based binaries.
  - `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/gradle:7.5.1-jdk${javaVersion}` in case it does.

### Go

- Your source code is copied to docker container with all its defined dependencies.

## External-buildpack

- The image is built using a zero-config [external buildpack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/).
- You can find a buildpack for almost any language or framework. The default buildpack used is
  `paketobuildpacks/builder:base`. You can configure the buildpack used by specifying the `buildpack` property.
  {/* To show
  a list of available buildpacks for a given language/framework combination, you can use the
  [buildpack:suggest](/cli/commands/buildpack-suggest/) command. */}
- The buildpack scans the specified source directory and automatically determines how the build the image for a given
  application.
- The image is uploaded to a pre-created (AWS ECR) container registry.

      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

## Nixpacks

- The image is built using [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs).
- In most cases, building and deploying an app with Nixpacks should just work with no configuration needed.
  {/* To show
  a list of available buildpacks for a given language/framework combination, you can use the
  [buildpack:suggest](/cli/commands/buildpack-suggest/) command. */}
- Nixpacks scans the specified source directory and automatically determining how the build the image for a given
  application.
- The image is uploaded to a pre-created (AWS ECR) container registry.

```yml

  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}

      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

## Custom-dockerfile

- The image is built from your own [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
- You need to configure `buildContextPath`. Stacktape will look for a Dockerfile in this directory (or use a Dockerfile
  specified by `dockerfilePath`).
- The image is uploaded to a pre-created (AWS ECR) container registry.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CustomDockerfileCwImagePackagingProps" />

```yml

  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: custom-dockerfile
        properties:
          buildContextPath: ./server

      # {stop-highlight}
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
```

## Prebuilt-image

- Pre-built image is used.
- To use private images, you need to configure `repositoryCredentialsSecretArn`. The body of the secret should have the
  following format: `{"username" : "<<privateRegistryUsername>>", "password" : "<<privateRegistryPassword>>"}`. Secrets
  can be managed directly using Stacktape. For more information, refer to
  [secrets docs](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/secrets/).
