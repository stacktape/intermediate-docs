# Introduction

Budget control allows you to watch your spending and configure email notifications when limits/thresholds are exceeded.

To use budget control, you first need to [enable Stacktape cost allocation tags](/user-guides/enabling-budgeting/).

<Warning>

Budget control currently only watches prices for AWS resources. It does not aggregate prices for resources managed by
third-party providers (such as [MongoDb Atlas Clusters](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters) or
[Upstash Redis](/resources/upstash-redis-databases)).

</Warning>

<Warning>

If you're using custom-defined AWS Cloudformation resources configured in (`cloudformationResources` section), these
resources might not be correctly attributed to your stack and therefore will not add to the spend.

This is due to AWS Cloudformation not propagating tags to all resources of your stack (AWS limitation).

All Stacktape-managed resource are correctly attributed to the spend.

</Warning>

# Usage

<PropertiesTable definitionName="BudgetControl" />

```yml
# {start-highlight}
budgetControl:
  limit: 100 # USD
# {stop-highlight}
```

## Notifications

<PropertiesTable definitionName="BudgetNotification" searchForReferencesInDefinition="BudgetControl" />

-   Notification sends email(s) to specified email recipients when the notification condition is met.
-   Notifications are triggered:
    -   when the **actual** spend is over specified threshold.
    -   when the **forecasted** spend is forecasted to get over specified threshold.
-   You can configure up to 5 notifications per stack.

## Actual budget type notifications

If you configure `budgetType` to `ACTUAL` (or don't specify budget type), the notification is triggered when the
**actual** spend goes over your budget limit (100$ in the following example).

```yml
# {start-highlight}
budgetControl:
  limit: 100 # USD
  notifications:
    - emails:
        - mail1@example.com
        - mail2@example.com
# {stop-highlight}
```

## Forecasted budget type notifications

If you configure `budgetType` to `FORECASTED`, the notification is triggered when the **forecasted** spend goes over
your budget limit (80$ in the following example).

```yml
# {start-highlight}
budgetControl:
  limit: 100
  notifications:
    - budgetType: FORECASTED
      thresholdPercentage: 80
      emails:
        - mail1@example.com
# {stop-highlight}
```

<Warning>

AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts. If you set a notification to trigger
based on a **FORECASTED** amount, this notification isn't triggered until you have enough historical usage information.
Therefore we advise using forecasted notifications mainly for long-running production stacks. To learn more about
budgets, refer to
[AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-best-practices.html#budgets-best-practices-alerts)
