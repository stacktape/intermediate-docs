# Introduction

<PropDescription definitionName="ConfigRoot" propertyName="scripts" descType="ld" />

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  buildWeb:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommand: npx gatsby build
  # {stop-highlight}

hooks:
  beforeDeploy:
    - scriptName: buildWeb
```

# Local script

**Local script** is executed locally (from the same host from which the stacktape command is being executed):

- The script must define one of `executeCommand`, `executeScript`, `executeCommands` or `executeScripts` properties.
- Use `connectTo` property for listing resources of your stack which you will be accessing from your script. Stacktape
  will then automatically inject environment variables needed for connecting to those resources into your script. For
  more details, see section [Using connectTo](#connecting-to-resources).

## Using executeCommand

-   Executes the specified command in a separate shell process. Uses `/bin/bash` on UNIX systems and default shell(usually `cmd.exe`) on Windows systems.
-   The command will be executed on the machine running the Stacktape command. If the command works on your machine, it doesn't mean it works for people or machines with different OSes or shells.
-   Only one of `executeScript`, `executeScripts`, `executeCommand` or `executeCommands` can be configured.

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  buildWeb:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommand: npx gatsby build
  # {stop-highlight}
```

## Using executeScript

-   The script can be written in **Javascript**, **Typescript** or **Python**.
-   The script is executed in a separate process.
-   The script is executed using an executable configured using `defaults:configure` command or a default executable on your machine:
    -   `node` for Javascript and Typescript
    -   `python` for Python
-   Only one of `executeScript`, `executeScripts`, `executeCommand` or `executeCommands` can be configured.

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  sendSlackNotification:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeScript: scripts/send-slack-notification.ts
  # {stop-highlight}
```

```ts
import { WebClient } from "@slack/web-api";

// An access token (from your Slack app or custom integration - xoxp, xoxb)
const token = "my-access-token";
// This argument can be a channel ID, a DM ID, a MPDM ID, or a group ID
const conversationId = "my-conversation-id";
const slackClient = new WebClient(token);
const errorData = JSON.parse(process.env.STP_ERROR);

(async () => {
  await slackClient.chat.postMessage({
    channel: conversationId,
    text: errorData.message
  });
})();
```

## Using executeCommands

-   Commands are executed in sequential order.
-   Each command is executed in a separate shell process. Uses `/bin/bash` on UNIX systems and default shell(usually `cmd.exe`) on Windows systems.
-   Commands will be executed on the machine running the Stacktape command. If a command works on your machine, it doesn't mean it works for people or machines with different OSes or shells.
-   Only one of `executeScript`, `executeScripts`, `executeCommand` or `executeCommands` can be configured.

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  buildWeb:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommands:
        - poetry run python manage.py makemigrations
        - poetry run python manage.py migrate
  # {stop-highlight}
```

## Using executeScripts

-   Scripts are executed in sequential order.
-   Script can be written in **Javascript**, **Typescript** or **Python**.
-   Each script is executed in a separate process.
-   Each script is executed using an executable configured using `defaults:configure` command or a default executable on your machine:
    -   `node` for Javascript and Typescript
    -   `python` for Python
-   Only one of `executeScript`, `executeScripts`, `executeCommand` or `executeCommands` can be configured.

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  sendSlackNotification:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeScripts:
        - scripts/run-migration.ts
        - scripts/send-slack-notification.ts
  # {stop-highlight}
```

# Local script with bastion tunneling

**Local script with bastion tunneling** executes in the same way as **local script**.

In addition, when using **local script with bastion tunneling**, connections to selected resources listed in
**connectTo** list, are tunneled through bastion server:

- When using tunneled connection, you are using secured encrypted connection running through the bastion server of your
  stack (instead of connecting to the resource directly over the internet).
- Tunneled connection allows you to connect to resources which do not have public endpoint and are only accessible
  within stack's [default VPC](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/vpcs/#default-vpc) such as private
  **relational-database** or **redis-cluster** from your local host (where script is executed).
- To use the tunneled endpoint of the resource (instead of using direct endpoint) in your script/command, use
  environment variables injected by [connectTo](#connecting-to-resources) property. These environment variables are
  automatically adjusted to use the tunneled endpoints.

<Info>

Your stack must contain [bastion](/resources/bastion-servers/) resource to use this type of script.

</Info>

## Example script with tunneling

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  migrateDb:
    type: local-script-with-bastion-tunneling
    properties:
      executeScript: migrate.ts
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase
  # {stop-highlight}

hooks:
  afterDeploy:
    - scriptName: migrateDb

resources:
  myBastion:
    type: bastion

  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      # database is only accessible from withing VPC
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: vpc
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: my_secret_pass
```

> Stacktape config using the migration script with tunneling

```ts
import { DbClient } from './db';

// using environment variable which was automatically injected thanks to connectTo property
// injected environment variables are using tunneled endpoint
const databaseConnectionString = process.env.STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING;

const client = new DbClient({ connectionString: databaseConnectionString });

// perform migrations with the client

client.close();
```

<Info>

Bastion tunneling is supported for following resource types:

- `relational-database`
- `redis-cluster`
- `application-load-balancer`
- `private-service` (with loadBalancing type application-load-balancer)

</Info>

# Bastion script

Bastion script is executed remotely on bastion server:

- Logs from the script execution are fetched real-time and printed to your local host.
- Executing commands directly on bastion server gives you unified way to execute set of commands from anywhere.
- Use `connectTo` property for listing resources of your stack which you will be accessing from your commands. Stacktape
  will then automatically inject environment variables needed for connecting to those resources into your script. For
  more details, see section [Using connectTo](#connecting-to-resources).

## Example bastion script

```yml
scripts:
  # {start-highlight}
  dbScript:
    type: bastion-script
    properties:
      executeCommands:
        - psql $STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING -c "SELECT 1 where 1=1"
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase
  # {stop-highlight}

hooks:
  afterDeploy:
    - scriptName: dbScript

resources:
  myBastion:
    type: bastion
    properties:
      runCommandsAtLaunch:
        - yum update
        - yum install postgresql.x86_64 -y

  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      accessibility:
        accessibilityMode: vpc
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          version: '16.2'
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: my_secret_pass
```

# Connecting to resources

By referencing resources in `connectTo` list, Stacktape automatically injects environment variables (containing information about resources in the list) into the script:

-   names of environment variables use upper-snake-case and are in form **STP\_`[RESOURCE_NAME]`\_`[VARIABLE_NAME]`**,
-   examples: `STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `STP_MY_EVENT_BUS_ARN`,

  

List of the injected environment variables depends on the resource type:

-   **Bucket**: `NAME`, `ARN`
-   **DynamoDB table**: `NAME`, `ARN`, `STREAM_ARN`
-   **MongoDB Atlas cluster**: `CONNECTION_STRING`
-   **Relational(SQL) database**: `CONNECTION_STRING`, `JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING`, `HOST`, `PORT` (in case of aurora multi instance cluster additionally: `READER_CONNECTION_STRING`, `READER_JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING`, `READER_HOST`)
-   **Redis cluster**: `HOST`, `READER_HOST`, `PORT`
-   **Event bus**: `ARN`
-   **Function**: `ARN`
-   **Batch job**: `JOB_DEFINITION_ARN`, `STATE_MACHINE_ARN`
-   **User auth pool**: `ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, `ARN`
-   **SNS Topic**: `ARN`, `NAME`
-   **SQS Queue**: `ARN`, `NAME`, `URL`
-   **Upstash Kafka topic**: `TOPIC_NAME`, `TOPIC_ID`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `TCP_ENDPOINT`, `REST_URL`
-   **Upstash Redis**: `HOST`, `PORT`, `PASSWORD`, `REST_TOKEN`, `REST_URL`, `REDIS_URL`
-   **Private service**: `ADDRESS`
-   **Web service**: `URL`

```yml
scripts:
  dbScript:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      # environment variable $STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING is injected thanks to connectTo
      executeCommands:
        - psql $STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING -c "SELECT * FROM users"
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myDatabase
      # {stop-highlight}

resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t3.micro
```

> Example config using script with connectTo

<Info>

If you are using `local-script-with-bastion-tunneling` script, connections to selected resources listed in `connectTo`
are tunneled through bastion host. This allows for accessing resources, which are only accessible from within the VPC
and increases security of connection. Refer to
[bastion tunneling docs](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/#local-script-with-bastion-tunneling) for more
information.

</Info>

# Executing script

The script can be executed in 2 ways:

- using [script:run command](/cli/commands/script-run/)

  ```bash
  stacktape script:run --scriptName <<scriptName>> --stage <<stage>>
  ```

- inside a [hook](/configuration/hooks/)

# Environment

Most commonly used types of environment variables:

-   Static - string, number or boolean (will be stringified).
-   Result of a [custom directive](/configuration/directives/#custom-directives).
-   Referenced property of another resource (using **$ResourceParam** directive). To learn more, refer to [referencing parameters guide](/configuration/referencing-parameters/). If you are using environment variables to inject information about resources into your script, see also property [connectTo](/configuration/scripts/#connecting-to-resources) which simplifies this process.
-   Value of a [secret](/resources/secrets/) (using [$Secret directive](/configuration/directives/#secret)).

```yml
scripts:
  migrateDb:
    executeScript: scripts/migrate-db.ts
    environment:
      # {start-highlight}
      - name: DB_CONNECTION_STRING
        value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'connectionString')
      # {stop-highlight}

resources:
  mainDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserPassword: my_secret_password
      engine:
        type: mysql
        properties:
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t2.micro
```

# Giving permissions to script

You can use property `assumeRoleOfResource` to grant script AWS permissions.

-   If specified, the script will be executed with the permissions of the specified resource.
-   Resource must already be deployed when the script is executed.
-   On the background, the script is injected with AWS environment variables which are automatically picked up by most of the AWS SDKs and CLIs.
-   Supported resource types include:
    -   `function`
    -   `batch-job`
    -   `worker-service`
    -   `web-service`
    -   `private-service`
    -   `multi-container-workload`
    -   `nextjs-web`

```yml
scripts:
  seedDb:
    executeScript:
      scripts/seed-db.ts
      # {start-highlight}
    assumeRoleOfResource: myFunction
    # {stop-highlight}
    environment:
      - name: TABLE_NAME
        value: $ResourceParam('dynamoTable', 'name')

resources:
  dynamoTable:
    type: dynamo-db-table

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      allowAccessTo:
        - dynamoTable
```

> Script will have same AWS IAM permissions as myFunction
