# Overview

Alarms are easy way to get keep your infrastructure in check and swiftly receive notifications when your resources get
overwhelmed or faulty.

Alarms are always configured to monitor a specified metric of a specified resource type. After threshold for the metric
is broken, configured action is taken.

# Under the hood

Under the hood alarms are implemented as
[AWS Cloudwatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)

# Usage

Alarms can be created in 2 ways:

- [Global alarms](#global-alarms) - created through Stacktape console. These alarms are applied to all resources of a
  certain _type_ managed by Stacktape.
- [In-config alarms](#in-config-alarms) - you can specify alarm directly on the resource in your _stacktape config
  file_.

# Global Alarms

Global alarms are created through [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/alarms). By creating alarm in
console, you are **creating a template(blueprint) of an alarm**. Only when you deploy(create/update) your stack after
creating global alarm (and alarm is eligible for your stack's **serviceName** and **stage**), actual alarm is created
for the eligible resources of your stack.

<br />

When configuring global alarm you can specify:

- what type of resource and metric you wish to monitor
- thresholds for the metric
- automatic **Slack** or **email** notifications
- which stacks does the alarm apply to (`serviceName`, `stage`)

<Warning>

Global alarms you create in console get applied only to resources in stacks **that are created/updated after the global
alarm was created in console**. In other words, if you create global alarm, you need to use
[deploy command](/cli/commands/deploy/) to apply alarms to resources in your stacks.

</Warning>

## Creating Global Alarm

1. Go to [Stacktape console alarms page](https://console.stacktape.com/alarms) and click `Create new alarm` button

![Alarm page](../static/alarms/alarm-page.png)

2. Configure alarm according to your needs. In our example we are creating alarm to monitor Lambda functions' error
   rate. We are also limiting alarm only to **prod** stage (used for production environments).

![Creating alarm](../static/alarms/create-alarm.png)

3. After creating alarm you can use [deploy command](/cli/commands/deploy/) on your stack to create actual alarms in the
   stack.

# In-config Alarms

You can specify alarm directly in the stacktape config file as a property of a resource which should be monitored.

```yml
resources:
  myLambdaFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'lambdas/js-lambda.js'
      # {start-highlight}
      alarms:
        - trigger:
            type: lambda-error-rate
            properties:
              thresholdPercent: 5
          notificationTargets:
            - type: slack
              properties:
                conversationId: C038XXXXXX
                accessToken: $Secret('slack-access-token')
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Schema of alarm

<PropertiesTable definitionName="LambdaAlarm" />

Alarm consists of 3 parts:

1. [Trigger](#trigger) - Type of the trigger specifies what metric will be monitored.
2. [Notifications](#notifications)(OPTIONAL) - Specifies where to send notification when alarm is triggered.
3. [Evaluation](#evaluation)(OPTIONAL) - Configures evaluation period (interval) for the monitored metric.

## Trigger

Type of the trigger specifies what metric will be monitored. Depending on the type further properties of trigger can be
specified

<PropertiesTable definitionName="LambdaErrorRateTrigger" />

```yml
resources:
  myLambdaFunction:
    type: function
    ...
      # {start-highlight}
      alarms:
        - trigger:
            type: lambda-error-rate
            properties:
              thresholdPercent: 5
      # {stop-highlight}
```

<Info>

See section [Trigger types](#trigger-types) to see all available alarms

              properties:
                conversationId: C038XXXXXX
                accessToken: $Secret('slack-access-token')
      # {stop-highlight}
```

```

**Email** integration:

```yml
resources:
  myResource:
    type: ...
    properties:
      ...
      alarms:
        - trigger:
            ...
      # {start-highlight}
          notificationTargets:
            - type: email
              properties:
                sender: alarm@company.com
                recipient: support@company.com
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## Evaluation

Configures evaluation period (interval) for the monitored metric.

<PropertiesTable definitionName="AlarmEvaluation" />

```yml
resources:
  myResource:
    type: ...
    properties:
      ...
      alarms:
        - trigger:
            ...
      # {start-highlight}
          evaluation:
            period: 200
      # {stop-highlight}
```

-   You can pick any metric available in the list below
-   Threshold will be compared with the calculated value which is calculated using the formula `statistic(CHOSEN_METRIC)` where:
-   `statistic` - is a statistic function applied to the collected values (metrics) retrieved during the evaluation period (`avg`(average) by default)

<PropertiesTable definitionName="SqsQueueReceivedMessagesCountTrigger" />

## Sqs Queue Not Empty

-   By default trigger is fired when the queue is not empty.
-   For queue to be considered empty all of these metrics exposed by SQS queue must be 0 during the evaluation period:
    -   `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`
    -   `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`
    -   `NumberOfMessagesReceived`
    -   `NumberOfMessagesSent`
