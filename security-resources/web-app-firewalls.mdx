# Overview

- Web app firewall is a service that protects your internet-connected applications from common web exploits that can
  affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

- To put it simple, it is a list of rules and defined actions based on the result of the rule evaluation.

- With web app firewall can:

  - Use managed rule groups(containing predefined, ready-to-use rules maintained by experts for you), or use your own
    custom rule groups that protect resources from malicious traffic.
  - Easily specify rate based rules, to prevent overloading of your resources.

- It is commonly placed between your web application and public internet (untrusted network) to filter the traffic.

- Following Stacktape resources can be used with Web app firewall:

  - [Application load balancer](/resources/application-load-balancers/#using-firewall)
  - [Web Service](/compute-resources/web-services/#using-firewall)
  - [User Pool](/resources/userpools-and-authentication/#using-firewall)
  - [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/resources/cdns/#using-firewall)

# Basic usage

```yml
resources:
  # {start-highlight}
  myFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      scope: regional
  # {stop-highlight}
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: index.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
      loadBalancing:
        type: application-load-balancer
      # {start-highlight}
      useFirewall: myFirewall
      # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example firewall config used with web service

# Scope

Scope determines whether you wish to use web app firewall with a regional resource or a cdn:

-   Use `cdn` if you wish to use firewall with CDN - CDN can be enabled on resources such as HTTP API Gateway, Bucket, Application load balancer or Web Service.
-   Use `regional` if you wish to use firewall directly with one of the following resources: Application load balancer, User Pool or Web Service

<Warning>
  Scope can't be changed after the firewall is created. If you need to change the scope, you will need to delete old
  `web-app-firewall` and create a new one.
</Warning>

# Rules

All requests coming to the resources protected by `web-app-firewall` are evaluated against the specified rules.

Rule can be a reference to **managed-rule-group** or user defined **custom-rule-group** or **rate-based-rule**.

-   **managed-rule-group**
    -   references rule group pre-created by AWS or other vendors for specific use cases.
    -   referenced by `name` and `vendorName`,
    -   For more information refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-list.html)
-   **custom-rule-group**
    -   references custom rule group created by you.
    -   referenced by rule group's `arn`
-   **rate-based-rule**
    -   tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span
    -   you can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
    -   For more information refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_RateBasedStatement.html)

## Default rules

- When there are no rules specified, Web app firewall will use default set of rules that will protect your resources
  from the most common attacks and exploits. Specifically it will use two managed rule groups provided by AWS:

  - **Common rule set** rule group (AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet)
    - Contains rules that are generally applicable to web applications
    - Provides protection against exploitation of a wide range of vulnerabilities, including some of the high risk and
      commonly occurring vulnerabilities described in OWASP publications such as
      [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  - **Known bad inputs** rule group (AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet)
    - Contains rules to block request patterns that are known to be invalid and are associated with exploitation or
      discovery of vulnerabilities
    - This can help reduce the risk of a malicious actor discovering a vulnerable application

- You can find more information about these rule groups in the
  [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html).

## Managed rule groups

- Managed rule groups are predefined sets of rules that are maintained by AWS or third-party vendors. They are updated
  on a regular basis to keep up with the latest threats.

- Rule groups managed by AWS are usually free of charge (although each referenced rule group counts as one rule, so it
  adds to the total costs), but some third-party vendors might charge extra for their rule groups.

- You can find more information about managed rule groups in the
  [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-managed-rule-groups.html).

```yml
resources:
  regionalFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      scope: regional
      # {start-highlight}
      rules:
        - type: managed-rule-group
          properties:
            name: AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
            vendorName: AWS
            priority: 0
        # {stop-highlight}
```

## Custom rule groups

- Most common use case for using custom rule group is when you or your organization already have a set of rules you want
  to use across multiple applications.

- You can also manage custom rule groups using Stacktape, but you will need to use custom CloudFormation resources to
  achieve this.

- To use existing custom rule group, just specify its ARN in the configuration

```yml
resources:
  regionalFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      scope: regional
      # {start-highlight}
      rules:
        - type: custom-rule-group
          properties:
            name: CustomRuleGroup
            arn: <<ARN of existing rule group>>
            priority: 0
        # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example reference to custom rule group

<PropertiesTable definitionName="CustomRuleGroupProps" searchForReferencesInDefinition="WebAppFirewallProps" />

## Rate based rules

- tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a
  limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span
- you can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.

- There are two ways of aggregation:

-   `IP` - Aggregate the request counts based on the IP addresses of the requests.
-   `FORWARDED_IP` - Aggregate the request counts based on the IP addresses in the specified header
    -   If you choose this option, you can also specify the `headerName` and `fallbackBehavior` in the `forwardedIPConfig` property.
    -   If you don't specify these properties the default values are `X-Forwarded-For` and `NO_MATCH` respectively. For more information about rate-based rules refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_RateBasedStatement.html)

```yml
resources:
  regionalFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      scope: regional
      # {start-highlight}
      rules:
        - type: rate-based-rule
          properties:
            name: RateRule
            limit: 100
            aggregateBasedOn: IP
            priority: 0
        # {stop-highlight}
```

> Example rate-based rule

<PropertiesTable definitionName="RateBasedStatementProps" searchForReferencesInDefinition="WebAppFirewallProps" />

# Monitoring

- Each rule and firewall itself can be monitored using AWS CloudWatch or inside AWS WAF console.

- **Default behavior** is, that collection of metrics and sampled requests is **enabled for the firewall** as a whole,
  but **disabled for the individual rules**. This behavior can be changed by specifying `metricsEnabled` and
  `sampledRequestsEnabled` inside rule or firewall properties.

- Both metrics and sampled requests can be viewed in the AWS WAF console. In addition, metrics can be viewed in the
  CloudWatch console as well.
- Stacktape will automatically create a link to the AWS WAF console and CloudWatch metrics dashboard (if some metrics
  are enabled) in the Stacktape management console

- You can learn more about
  [metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing-view-metrics.html) and
  [sampled requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing-view-sample.html) in the AWS
  documentation

# Pricing

You are charged for:

- **Firewall** (WebACL)
  - $5.00 per month (prorated hourly)
