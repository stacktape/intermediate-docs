# Introduction

- Secrets allow you to securely store credentials, API Keys and other secrets required by your applications, databases,
  services, and IT resources.
- Secrets are stored within your AWS account using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

# Managing secrets

- You can store secrets in 2 ways:
  - **simple strings**, e.g. `mypassword`
  - **json objects**, such as `{ "username": "my-username", "password": "my-password" }`
- Secret names must use only Unicode characters and must be 1 - 512 characters long.
- Secret values must be at most 65,536 bytes long.
- Stacktape allows you to manage your secrets using CLI commands:

## Creating and updating a secret

- using [secret:create command](/cli/commands/secret-create)

```bash
stacktape secret:create --region my-region
```

- You will be prompted to input all the required values.
- Updating the secret can be done using the same command. If the secret with the given name already exists, you will be
  prompted if you want to update it.

## Deleting a secret

- using [secret:delete command](/cli/commands/secret-delete)

```bash
stacktape secret:delete --region my-region
```

## Getting a secret value

- using [secret:get command](/cli/commands/secret-get)

```bash
stacktape secret:get --region my-region
```

# Referencing secrets

- Secrets can be easily referenced within your configuration using a
  [$Secret() directive](/configuration/directives/#secret).

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql-serverless
      credentials:
        # {start-highlight}
        # using a simple string as a secret value, e.g. "my-password"
        masterUserName: $Secret('masterUserName')
        # using an object as a secret value, e.g. "{ password: "my-password" }"
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('databaseCredentials.password')
        # {stop-highlight}
```

<Warning>

After you update a secret, all of the already deployed stacks which are using this secret will keep using **the old
version**. In order for the deployed stack to use the new (updated) version of the secret, you need to redeploy the
stack.

</Warning>

# Pricing

- You are charged $0.4 / month for every existing secret
