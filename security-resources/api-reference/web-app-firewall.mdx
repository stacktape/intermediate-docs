This example shows a basic web app firewall configuration.

Web Application Firewall resource

- You can use firewall to protect your resources from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myWebAppFirewall:
    type: web-app-firewall
    properties:
      # Specifies whether this firewall is to be used with CDN or with regional resources
      #
      # - Use `cdn` if you wish to use firewall with CDN - CDN can be enabled on resources such as HTTP API Gateway, Bucket, Application load balancer or Web Service.
      # - Use `regional` if you wish to use firewall directly with one of the following resources: Application load balancer, User Pool or Web Service
      #
      # - Type: enum: [cdn, regional]
      # - Required: true
      # - Allowed values: [cdn, regional]
      scope: cdn
      # Default action for the firewall if no rule matches
      #
      # - `Allow` – If you want to allow most users to access your website, but you want to block access to attackers whose requests originate from specified IP addresses,
      # or whose requests appear to contain malicious SQL code or specified values, choose Allow for the default action. Then, when you add rules to your firewall, add
      # rules that identify and block the specific requests that you want to block.
      # - `Block` – If you want to prevent most users from accessing your website, but you want to allow access to users whose requests originate from specified IP addresses,
      # or whose requests contain specified values, choose Block for the default action. Then when you add rules to your firewall, add rules that identify and allow the
      # specific requests that you want to allow in. By default, for the Block action, the AWS resource responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.
      # the response.
      #
      # - Type: enum: [Allow, Block]
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: 'Allow'
      # - Allowed values: [Allow, Block]
      defaultAction: 'Allow'
      # List of rules to be used by the firewall
      #
      # Rule can be a reference to **managed-rule-group** or user defined **custom-rule-group** or **rate-based-rule**.
      # - **managed-rule-group**
      # - references rule group pre-created by AWS or other vendors for specific use cases.
      # - referenced by `name` and `vendorName`,
      # - For more information refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-list.html)
      # - **custom-rule-group**
      # - references custom rule group created by you.
      # - referenced by rule group's `arn`
      # - **rate-based-rule**
      # - tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate
      # exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span
      # - you can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.
      # - For more information refer to [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_RateBasedStatement.html)
      #
      # - If you do not specify any rules, the stacktape will use managed rule groups `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet` and `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` to protect your application.
      #
      # - Type: array<union (anyOf)>
      # - Required: false
      rules:
      # A map of custom response keys and content bodies
      #
      # When you create a rule with a block action, you can send a custom response to the web request. You
      # define these for the firewall, and then use them in the rules and default actions
      # that you define.
