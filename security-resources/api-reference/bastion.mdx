This example shows a basic bastion configuration.

Bastion resource

- Bastion instance resource helps you access the resources of your stack protected in private network.
- It leverages `keyless` SSH connections and tunnels for maximum security.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myBastion:
    type: bastion
    properties:
      # Host instance size
      #
      # - Instance size you wish to use for your bastion host
      # - Default instance size is `t3.micro` (Free Tier eligible)
      #
      # - Type: string
      # - Required: false
      # - Default: t3.micro
      instanceSize: t3.micro
      # Commands to be ran on launch (creation) of the bastion instance
      #
      # - Commands are run as the root user (do not use sudo).
      # - Modifying this list after bastion was already created will force replacement of the bastion instance.
      # This means that any data that was manually created on the old bastion instance will be lost.
      # - Use this if to install dependencies and packages that might be required for your bastion scripts
      #
      # - Type: array<string>
      # - Required: false
      runCommandsAtLaunch:
        - example-value
      # Configures logging for bastion host
      #
      # - Multiple log types are collected from you bastion host. You can specify log behaviour for each different log type.
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: false
      logging:
        # Configures log behavior for log group collecting logs from `/var/log/messages` of your bastion host
        #
        # - Logs contain global system messages, including the messages that are logged during system startup.
        # There are several things that are logged in /var/log/messages including mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc.
        # - By default "messages" logs are retained for 30 days.

          # Configures forwarding of logs to specified destination
          #
          # - Log forwarding is done using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) delivery stream.
          # - When using log forwarding, you will incur costs based on the amount of data being transferred to the destination (~$0.03 per transferred GB).

          # - The endpoint must follow [Firehose request and response specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html).
