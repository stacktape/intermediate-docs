# Overview

Using Stacktape in your CI/CD pipeline is very straightforward.

Generally, you need to add `STACKTAPE_API_KEY` as a secret and a short workflow/pipeline config to your repository. The
config generally contains these two steps:

1. Install Stacktape
   - `curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | bash` for Linux platform
   - `curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/alpine.sh | bash` for alpine Linux platform.
2. Deploy using `stacktape deploy --projectName <<projectName>> --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>`.

This guide contains step by step tutorials for these CI/CD environments:

1. [Github Actions](#1-using-github-actions)
2. [Gitlab CI/CD](#2-using-gitlab-ci-cd)
3. [Bitbucket CI/CD](#3-using-bitbucket-ci)

# Prerequisites

1. **Stacktape account**. If you don't have an account, please [sign up](https://console.stacktape.com/sign-up)

2. **AWS account connected** to your Stacktape organization. Connecting your account takes ~2 minutes. You can connect
   it on [AWS accounts page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/aws-accounts)

3. **Empty Stacktape project** - If you do not have a project, you can create it on
   [projects page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/projects?createNewProject=true).

4. **Stacktape API key** - To authenticate your CI system with Stacktape, you need an API key. You can get it on
   [API keys page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/).

5. **Stacktape config** - your repository must contain `stacktape.yml` or `stacktape.ts` config. To create it, you have
   multiple options:

   1. **(Recommended)** Use the [interactive config editor](https://console.stacktape.com/template-editor). To learn
      about how to use it, head over to [using the config editor](/getting-started/using-config-editor).

   2. Use a [starter projects](/getting-started/starter-project) with a pre-configured Stacktape configuration.

   3. Follow one of the step-by-step tutorials. Currenctly available tutorials are
      [Fullstack Next.js T3 app](/tutorials/t3-nextjs-app) and [Web API](/tutorials/web-api).

   4. Write the config manually. To make this process easier, you can install
      [Stacktape VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stacktape.vscode-stacktape).

# 1. Using Github Actions

## 1.1 Create repository secret

- The deployment pipeline requires Stacktape credentials - `STACKTAPE_API_KEY`.
- Hard-coding API key into the pipeline file is unsafe, and you should use **Action secrets** instead.
- Action secrets are securely stored and accessible to all your workflows(actions) using the
  `${{ secrets.<<secret-name>> }}` syntax.

To create a secret, navigate to your Github repository's **Settings** tab and choose **Secrets and variables ->
Actions**. Create your API key secret by clicking on **New repository secret**.

![Navigate to repository secrets](../static/github-actions/secrets-1.png)

Fill in the secret name `STACKTAPE_API_KEY` and your API key (you can get it in
[API keys page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/)) as a secret, then add the secret.

![Add the secret](../static/github-actions/secrets-2.png)

## 1.2 Add workflow config

Create your Github action workflow configuration at `.github/workflows/<<your-workflow-name>>.yml` in your project root
directory.

The workflow configuration file is used to configure automated continuous integration and deployment workflows within
Github Actions. It specifies a **series of commands** that Github executes automatically to build, test, and deploy code
changes based on defined triggers.

**In your case, you will be installing and executing Stacktape in the workflow.**

Stacktape offers two ways to execute the deployment from within the workflow:

- Option A - Using codebuild:deploy
- Option B - Using deploy

### Option A - Using codebuild:deploy

When you use `stacktape codebuild:deploy` command, CLI executes the deployment remotely inside the Codebuild in your AWS
account. This means that the CLI that runs in the Github Actions container merely monitors the deployment - all the
packaging, uploading of the artifacts, and other operations are executed strictly within your AWS account (in
Codebuild). It also means you do not need any dependencies (such as Docker or Nodejs) installed in your Github Actions
container image since the CLI in the pipeline only oversees the deployment.

```yml
name: Deploy application using Stacktape
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Stacktape
        run: curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | bash
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy the stack
        run: stacktape codebuild:deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<projectName>>
        env:
          STACKTAPE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.STACKTAPE_API_KEY }}
```

> Example Github Actions workflow config using `stacktape codebuild:deploy`

### Option B - Using deploy

When you use `stacktape deploy` command, all of the operations, such as packaging and uploading artifacts, are executed
inside the Github Actions directly. When using this option, you must make sure to use a container image that already has
dependencies (namely Docker and NodeJS) installed. For example, you can use
`public.ecr.aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:5.0` container image (which is also used in Codebuild and
contains all the dependencies). However, using a large custom image can prolong the execution time because the image
must be downloaded every time the workflow executes.

```yml
name: Deploy application using Stacktape
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: public.ecr.aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:5.0
    steps:
      - name: Install Stacktape
        run: curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | bash
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy the stack
        run: stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<projectName>>
        env:
          STACKTAPE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.STACKTAPE_API_KEY }}
```

> Example Github Actions workflow config using `stacktape deploy`

## 1.3 Push to the Github repository

The pipeline is triggered when you push to the main branch of your Github repository.

1. `git commit -m "setup Stacktape deployments"`
2. `git push -u origin main`

## 1.4 Monitor deployment

To monitor the deployment progress, navigate to your Github repository and select **Actions** tab.

![Inspecting ongoing actions](../static/github-actions/monitor-1.png)

In the workflow execution overview, you can find logs from the execution, along with other details. After the execution
succeeds, you can navigate to the Stacktape console using the link printed at the end of the logs to find more
information about your newly deployed project stage.

# 2. Using Gitlab CI

## 2.1 Create CI/CD variable

- The deployment pipeline requires Stacktape credentials - `STACKTAPE_API_KEY`.
- Hard-coding API key into the pipeline file is unsafe, and you should use **Gitlab CI/CD variables** instead.
- Gitlab CI/CD variables are securely stored and accessible in your pipeline.

To create a Gitlab CI/CD variable, in your repository navigate to **Settings -> CI/CD**. Create the API key variable by
clicking **Add variable**.

![Navigating in CI/CD page](../static/gitlab-cicd/vars-1.png)

When filling in the variable info:

- remember to use "Masked" variable to avoid potential exposure
- fill in the key - `STACKTAPE_API_KEY`
- fill in the value - your Stacktape API key (you can get it in
  [API keys page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/))

![Creating variable](../static/gitlab-cicd/vars-2.png)

## 2.2 Add pipeline config

Create your Gitlab pipeline configuration file `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root directory of your project.

The pipeline configuration file is used to configure automated continuous integration and deployment pipelines within
Gitlab CI/CD. It specifies a **series of commands** that Gitlab executes automatically to build, test, and deploy code
changes based on defined triggers.

**In your case, you will be installing and executing Stacktape in the pipeline.**

Stacktape offers two ways to execute the deployment from within the pipeline:

- Option A - Using codebuild:deploy
- Option B - Using deploy

### Option A - Using codebuild:deploy

When you use `stacktape codebuild:deploy` command, CLI executes the deployment remotely inside the Codebuild in your AWS
account. This means that the CLI that runs in the Gitlab CI/CD container merely monitors the deployment - all the
packaging, uploading of the artifacts, and other operations are executed strictly within your AWS account (in
Codebuild). It also means you do not need any dependencies (such as Docker or Nodejs) installed in your Gitlab CI/CD
container image since the CLI in the pipeline only oversees the deployment.

```yml
deploy-app:
  image: node:latest
  rules:
    # only execute job on push to the master/main
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push" && $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  script:
    # install Stacktape
    - curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | bash
    # set PATH so that we can use the "stacktape" and "stp" aliases for the binary
    - export PATH=$PATH:/root/.stacktape/bin
    # deploy the stack
    - stacktape codebuild:deploy --stage glb --region eu-west-1 --projectName test-mess
```

> Example Gitlab `.gitlab-ci.yml` using `stacktape codebuild:deploy`

### Option B - Using deploy

When you use `stacktape deploy` command, all of the operations, such as packaging and uploading artifacts, are executed
inside the Gitlab CI/CD container directly. When using this option, you must make sure to use a container image that
already has dependencies installed (Docker if you use container compute resources, and NodeJS if you use stacktape
buildpacks). However, using a large custom image can prolong the execution time because it must be downloaded every time
the pipeline executes.

```yml
deploy-app:
  image: node:latest
  rules:
    # only execute job on push to the master/main
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push" && $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  script:
    # install Stacktape
    - curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | bash
    # set PATH so that we can use the "stacktape" and "stp" aliases for the binary
    - export PATH=$PATH:/root/.stacktape/bin
    # deploy the stack
    - stacktape deploy --stage glb --region eu-west-1 --projectName test-mess
```

> Example Gitlab `.gitlab-ci.yml` config using `stacktape deploy`

## 2.3 Push to the Gitlab repository

The pipeline is triggered when you push to the main branch of your Gitlab repository.

1. `git init --initial-branch=main`
2. `git commit -m "setup stacktape project"`
3. `git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:<<namespace-name>>/<<repo-name>>.git` (replace with your gitlab repository)
4. `git push -u origin main`

## 2.4 Monitor deployment

To monitor the deployment progress, navigate to your Gitlab project and select **Jobs** (in the **Build** section).

![Inspecting pipeline jobs](../static/gitlab-cicd/monitor-1.png)

In the pipeline execution overview, you can find logs from the execution, along with other details. After the execution
succeeds, you can navigate to the Stacktape console using the link printed at the end of the logs to find more
information about your newly deployed project stage.

# 3. Using Bitbucket CI

## 3.1 Create repository variable

- The deployment pipeline requires Stacktape credentials - `STACKTAPE_API_KEY`.
- Hard-coding API key into the pipeline file is unsafe, and you should use **Bitbucket repository variables** instead.
- Bitbucket repository variables are securely stored and accessible in your pipeline.

To create a Repository variable, in your repository navigate to **Repository settings**

![Inspecting pipelines](../static/bitbucket-pipelines/repovar-1.png)

In the repository settings find **Repository variables** in the pipelines section.

Fill in the variable info and add the variable:

- remember to use "Secured" variable to avoid potential exposure
- fill in the key - `STACKTAPE_API_KEY`
- fill in the value - your Stacktape API key (you can get it in
  [API keys page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/))

![Creating variable](../static/bitbucket-pipelines/repovar-2.png)

## 3.2 Add pipeline config

The `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file is used to configure automated continuous integration and deployment pipelines within
Bitbucket's repository. It specifies a **series of commands** that Bitbucket executes automatically to build, test, and
deploy code changes based on defined triggers.

**In your case, you will be installing and executing Stacktape in the pipeline.**

Stacktape offers two ways to execute the deployment from within the pipeline:

- Option A - Using codebuild:deploy
- Option B - Using deploy

### Option A - Using codebuild:deploy

container image since the CLI in the pipeline only oversees the deployment.

```yml
image: atlassian/default-image:4

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: "Deploy"
        deployment: production
        script:
          # install stacktape
          - curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh
          - export PATH="/root/.stacktape/bin:\\$PATH"
          # run stacktape
          - stacktape codebuild:deploy --projectName my-project-1 --stage production --region eu-west-1
```

        deployment: production
        script:
          # install stacktape
          - curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh
          - export PATH="/root/.stacktape/bin:\\$PATH"
          # run stacktape
          - stacktape deploy --projectName my-project-1 --stage production --region eu-west-1
```

> Example `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` using `stacktape deploy`

## 3.3 Push to the Bitbucket repository

The pipeline is triggered when you push to the main branch of your Bitbucket repository.

1. `git init --initial-branch=main`
2. `git commit -m "setup stacktape project"`
3. `git remote add origin https://<<bitbucket-usernme>>@bitbucket.org/<<project>>/<<repository>>.git` (replace with your
   Bitbucket repository information)
4. `git push -u origin main`

## 3.4 Monitor deployment

After you push the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file, the first deployment will automatically start.

To monitor the deployment progress, navigate to your Bitbucket repository and select **Pipelines**.

![Inspecting pipelines](../static/bitbucket-pipelines/pipelines.png)

In the pipeline execution overview, you can find logs from the execution, along with other details. After the execution
