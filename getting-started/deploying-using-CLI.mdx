# Prerequisites

To deploy a git project using Stacktape:

1. You must have a Stacktape account. If you don't have an account, please
   [sign up](https://console.stacktape.com/sign-up)

2. You must have an AWS account connected to your Stacktape organization. Connecting your account takes ~2 minutes. You
   can connect the account on [AWS accounts page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/aws-accounts)

# 1. Install Stacktape

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: "iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n",
      label: "Windows (PowerShell)"
    },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n", label: "Linux" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n", label: "Macos" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n", label: "Macos ARM" }
  ]}
/>

After the installation is complete, you might need to manually add Stacktape bin folder to PATH environment variable. To
do it, follow the instruction printed to the terminal.

## 1.1 Log in to Stacktape

You can login to Stacktape using simple command:

```bash
stacktape login
```

This command will prompt you for your Stacktape API key. You can get it on
[API keys page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/).

## 2. Configure your stack

You need to create a configuration file named `stacktape.yml` or `stacktape.ts` in the root directory of your project.

If you already have it, you can continue with [3. Deploy](#3-deploy) step.

If you do not have it yet, you have multiple options:

1.  **(Recommended)** Use the [interactive config editor](https://console.stacktape.com/template-editor). To learn about
    how to use it, head over to [using the config editor](/getting-started/using-config-editor).

2.  Use a [starter projects](/getting-started/starter-project) with a pre-configured Stacktape configuration.

3.  Follow one of the step-by-step tutorials. Currenctly available tutorials are
    [Fullstack Next.js T3 app](/tutorials/t3-nextjs-app) and [Web API](/tutorials/web-api).

4.  Write the config manually. To make this process easier, you can install
    [Stacktape VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stacktape.vscode-stacktape).

# 3. Deploy

Once you've successfully configured your stack, you can deploy it very easily - by a single command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --region <<region> --stage <<stage>> --projectName <<projectName>>
```

The arguments required by the command have the following meaning:

- **region** - the code of one of the
  [33 available AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions).
  For people in US, this will be likely `us-east-1`, and for EU customers `eu-west-1`.
- **stage** - arbitrary name of the stage (also called environment). E.g. `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`.
- **projectName** - name of the project this stack will belong to. This is used to distinguish your projects from each
  other in the Stacktape console. Use arbitrary, descriptive name, e.g. `todo-app`, `pet-eshop`, etc. In most cases,
  this is identical with the name of the git repository.

## 3.1 - Monitor the deployment

Stacktape continuously prints the information about the ongoing deployment to your terminal.

Once the deployment is finished, you'll be able to view the stack details in the Stacktape console.

At this point, you have a successfully deployed, production-grade AWS application, that follows all of the recommended
AWS best practices.
