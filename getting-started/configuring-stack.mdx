<br />

Stacktape is an Infrastructure as a Code tool, building on top of the
[many advantages](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/) of this approach.

For people coming from a world of ClickOps (clicking in a GUI to create resources), this might seem inconvenient.

This is why most of the Stacktape configuration can also be done using an interactive config editor (GUI). You will
learn more about it on the next page.

# 1. Configure resources

Resources are defined within the `resources` section of the template.

Every resource must have a unique name within the template. You can only use alphanumeric for the resource names.

Every Stacktape resource translates to multiple underlying AWS CloudFormation resources.

Example web service configuration:

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/server.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 2048
```

# 2. Configure packaging

For compute resources (the ones that run your code), you must configure how they will be packaged. Stacktape supports
multiple packaging methods.

<Info>

Stacktape has built-in, content-aware hashing mechanism, that will only build and re-deploy your workloads if the
application code or its dependencies have changed.

</Info>

## 2.1 Packaging containers

### 2.1.1 Stacktape image buildpack

<Info>

For Node.js application, Stacktape buildpack is probably the fastest and most efficient build tool out there. It creates
smallest possible images that only contain the code necessary for your application to work.

Note that if your application also need other files (such as graphql schema file) in order to run, please explicitly
specify them using `includeFiles`.

</Info>

Stacktape image buildpacks offer a heavily optimized way to package your applications directly from source code. You
configure the entryfile of your application, and Stacktape will figure out how to create a Docker image out of it,
including all of the application dependencies.

Currently supported languages are: Javascript, Typescript, Python, Java and Go.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/server.ts
      # {stop-highlight}
```

### 2.1.2 External buildpack

You can use any of the builders supported by [pack](https://paketo.io/docs/).

For example, you can use builder `paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base`, which will automatically detect which
[paketo buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples) to use.

You can also use heroku builder `heroku/builder:22`, which will automatically detect which
[heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#officially-supported-buildpacks) to use.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: external-buildpack
        properties:
          builder: heroku/builder:22
          sourceDirectoryPath: ./
      # {stop-highlight}
```

### 2.1.3 Custom Dockerfile

You can also use your own Dockerfile.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: custom-dockerfile
        properties:
          # All "COPY" instruction in the Dockerfile will be resolved relatively to this directory
          buildContextPath: ./
          # Path to the Dockerfile (relative to buildContextPath)
          dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
      # {stop-highlight}
```

### 2.1.4 Prebuilt image

You can also use your own prebuilt image from the docker repository.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: prebuilt-image
        properties:
          # The format is {registryUri}/{repositoryName}:{tag}
          image: repoUri/repoName:tag
      # {stop-highlight}
```

## 2.2 Packaging lambda functions

### 2.2.1 Stacktape lambda buildpack

Stacktape can also automatically and very efficiently package your lambda functions (with all of their dependencies).

Currently supported languages are: Javascript, Typescript, Python, Java and Go.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/my-lambda.ts
      # {stop-highlight}
```

### 2.2.2 Custom artifact

If you build your lambda functions on your own, simply point Stacktape to the pre-built lambda artifact.

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: custom-artifact
        properties:
          packagePath: ./my-artifact.zip
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# 3. Connect resources

Some Stacktape resources can be connected to other resources to allow interaction between them. Connecting resources
does 2 things:

- Injects environment variables required for connecting to a resource. The name of the injected environment variables is
  formed as CONSTANT_CASE resource name, prefixed by `STP`
- When needed, required _IAM_ and security group permissions are automatically added to allow communication between
  resources.

<br />

For example, you can connect your Web service to a SQL database.

This will:

- inject environment variables `STP_MAIN_DATABASES_CONNECTION_STRING`, `STP_MAIN_DATABASES_HOST` and
  `STP_MAIN_DATABASES_PORT` to the environment of **webService**

```yaml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/server.ts
      resources:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 2048
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - mainDatabase
      # {stop-highlight}
  mainDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties: ...more-properties...
```

Or to connect a lambda function to a DynamoDb table. This will:

- inject environment variables `STP_DYNAMO_DB_NAME` and `STP_DYNAMO_DB_ARN` to the environment of **myLambda** function
- add get / put / update / delete / scan / query _IAM_ permissions to the **myLambda** function

```yml
resources:
  myLambda:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/my-lambda.ts
      # {start-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - dynamoDb
      # {stop-highlight}
  dynamoDb:
    type: dynamo-db-table
    properties:
      primaryKey:
        partitionKey:
          name: id
          type: string
```

# 4. Configure scripts and hooks

## 4.1 Scripts

**Scripts** are used to specify and execute your custom scripts and commands. Scripts can be used for anything from
testing and building your application to performing database migrations. Specifying a script in the Stacktape config can
be beneficial for multiple reasons:

- scripts will be easily reusable by all members of your team,
- scripts can be executed automatically within lifecycle [hooks](#hooks) (before/after deploy/delete etc.) or manually
  using [script:run command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/script-run/),
- you can use `connectTo` property to easily inject environment variables needed for connecting to resources of your
  stack,
- you can leverage bastion scripts and bastion tunneling to access resources which are only accessible within VPC.

```yml
# {start-highlight}
scripts:
  buildWeb:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommand: npx gatsby build
# {stop-highlight}

resources:
  webBucket:
    type: hosting-bucket
    properties:
      uploadDirectoryPath: ./public
      hostingContentType: gatsby-static-website
```

To learn more, refer to this [dedicated page about scripts](../configuration/scripts.mdx).

## 4.2 Hooks

- Hooks allow you to execute a custom command or script before or after stacktape command is executed.
- Example use cases:
  - build, validate, or lint your application before deployment
  - run unit tests on your application before deployment
  - execute database migration after deployment
  - cleanup database before delete

The following snippet shows an example script that executes database schema migration. The script is listed in the
`afterDeploy` hooks to execute migration after each deployment.

```yml
# {start-highlight}
scripts:
  migrateDb:
    type: local-script
    properties:
      executeCommand: npx prisma db push
      connectTo:
        - mainDatabase

hooks:
  afterDeploy:
    - scriptName: migrateDb
#{stop-highlight}

resources:
  mainDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      credentials:
        masterUserName: admin_user
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('my-pass')
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          primaryInstance:
            instanceSize: db.t4g.micro
          version: "15.5"
```

To learn more, refer to this [dedicated page about hooks](/configuration/hooks).

# 5. Extend using CloudFormation

You can use the `cloudformationResources` section to extend your Stacktape template with AWS _Cloudformation_ resources.
This enables you to easily configure, manage, and interconnect Cloudformation resources with other resources in your
stack. As a result, you can leverage **the full power of AWS in a single unit configuration**.

```yml
# stacktape resources
resources:
  myLambda:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/my-lambda.ts
      environment:
        name: MONITOR_ARN
        # {start-highlight}
        # passing value from Cloudformation resource
        value: $CfResourceParam('AnomalyServiceMonitor', 'MonitorArn')
        # {stop-highlight}

# {start-highlight}
# Cloudformation resources
cloudformationResources:
  AnomalyServiceMonitor:
    Type: "AWS::CE::AnomalyMonitor"
    Properties:
      MonitorName: "MonitorName"
      MonitorType: "DIMENSIONAL"
      MonitorDimension: "SERVICE"
# {stop-highlight}
```

# 6. Override properties

Stacktape runs on top of _Cloudformation_. To make your life easier, Stacktape abstracts the complexities of
Cloudformation configurations and only exposes the essential parts that you need to set up your application in AWS.

However, when needed, Stacktape allows you to override the underlying Cloudformation resources to tweak and adjust low
level configurations to your needs.

In the following example, we are overriding (setting) `Description` property of underlying Cloudformation
[AWS::Lambda::Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html)
resource.

```yml
resources:
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: path/to/my/lambda.ts
    # {start-highlight}
    overrides:
      MyFunctionFunction:
        Description: "My overriden lambda function description"
    # {stop-highlight}
```

# 7. Add dynamic behavior

## 7.1 - Using directives

Directives can be used to add dynamic behavior to your templates. To learn more about directives, refer to
[directives docs](../configuration/directives.mdx).

### 7.1.1 - Built-in directives

Built-in directives are available for use within all of the Stacktape config files without any extra configuration.

For example, you can use built-in directives to set domain names for your web services dynamically.

```yaml
resources:
  myHttpApi:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      customDomains:
        # {start-highlight}
        # When deploying to stage "staging", the domain will be "staging-api.mydomain.com"
        - domainName: $Format('{}-{}', $Stage(), 'api.mydomain.com')
        # {stop-highlight}
```

### 7.1.2 Custom directives

You can use custom directives to further customize your templates. The following example shows how to adjust database
instance size based on stage (environment).

<br />

1. **Write the directive code**

```typescript
export const getDbInstanceSize = (stage: string) => {
  if (stage === "production") {
    return "db.m5.xlarge";
  }
  return "db.t2.micro";
};
```

2. **Register the directive**

```yaml
directives:
  - name: getDbInstanceSize
    filePath: directives.ts:getDbInstanceSize
```

3. **Use the directive**

```yml
resources:
  myDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      engine:
        type: postgres
        properties:
          primaryInstance:
            # {start-highlight}
            instanceSize: $getDbInstanceSize($Stage())
            # {stop-highlight}
      ...more properties...
```

<br />

## 7.2 Using Javascript/Typescript configs

Besides `YAML`, you can write your configuration in `Javascript` and `Typescript`.

If you also want to have type safety for your configurations, install `@stacktape/sdk`.

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { lang: "bash", code: "npm install --dev @stacktape/sdk\n", label: "npm" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "yarn add --dev @stacktape/sdk\n", label: "yarn" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "pnpm add -D @stacktape/sdk\n", label: "pnpm" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "bun add -D @stacktape/sdk\n", label: "bun" }
]} />

For javascript files, you can use it in the following way:

```javascript
/** @type {import('@stacktape/sdk').StacktapeConfig} */
const config = {
  // your config
};

export default config;
```

For typescript files:

```typescript
import { StacktapeConfig } from "@stacktape/sdk";

const config: StacktapeConfig = {
  // your config
};

export default config;
```

You can also access other stack parameters, if you export a `getConfig` function.

The function receives an object containing stack parameters and must return a valid Stacktape configuration.

The following example shows how to adjust container resources based on stage (environment).

```typescript
import type { GetConfigFunction } from '@stacktape/sdk';

export const getConfig: GetConfigFunction = ({ stage }) => {
  return {
    resources: {
      webService: {
        type: "web-service",
        properties: {
          resources: {
            cpu: stage === 'production' ? 0.5 : 2,
            memory: stage === 'production' ? 512 : 4096
          }
        ...more properties...
      },
    }
  }
};
```
