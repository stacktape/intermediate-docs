title: "Upstash Serverless Redis"
order: 190
---

# Overview

- Redis is a fast, NoSQL in-memory data store that can provide sub-millisecond latency.

- [Upstash provides Redis](https://upstash.com/) as a serverless service. This enables users to leverage Redis without
  the need for paying and managing their own servers.

- Upstash uses **Per-Request pricing** so you do NOT need to pay for the servers/instances and you only pay for request
  you make.

- Low latency data, ease of use, and pay-per-request pricing makes Upstash a perfect choice for Serverless applications.

# When to use

## Advantages

- **REST API** - access your database using [simple REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/restapi)
- **Secure** - with option to enable TLS out of the box
- **High availability** - with option to enable multi-zone replication
- **Pay-per-request** - pay only for what you use. Refer to
  [Upstash pricing](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/overall/pricing)
- **Scalable**

## Disadvantages

- **Separate billing** - Even though Stacktape seamlessly integrates Upstash Redis to your stacks, you still need to
  manage your billing separately.

# Provider configuration

- You must have an Upstash account. To create one, head over to
  [Upstash registration page](https://console.upstash.com/login).

- You need following to configure the provider:

  - Email address of your Upstash account (`accountEmail`).
  - API Key associated with the account (`apiKey`).

- You can obtain API Key in [Upstash account management console](https://console.upstash.com/account/api).
- The recommended way to store your credentials is to use [secrets](/resources/secrets/).

```yml
# {start-highlight}
providerConfig:
  upstash:
    accountEmail: xxxxx.yyyy@example.com
    apiKey: $Secret('upstash-api-key')
# {stop-highlight}

resources:
  myUpstash:
    type: upstash-redis
```

<PropertiesTable definitionName="UpstashProviderConfig" />

# Basic usage

```yml
providerConfig:
  upstash:
    accountEmail: xxxxx.yyyy@example.com
    apiKey: $Secret('upstash-api-key')

resources:
  # {start-highlight}
  myUpstash:
    type: upstash-redis
  # {stop-highlight}

  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: lambdas/upstash.ts
      environment:
        - name: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
          value: $ResourceParam('myUpstash', 'restUrl')
        - name: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
          value: $ResourceParam('myUpstash', 'restToken')
```

```ts
import upstash from '@upstash/redis';

const redis = upstash({ url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL, token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN });

export default async (event) => {
  // write data
  let { data, error } = await redis.set('key1', 'value1');

  // read data
  ({ data, error } = await redis.get('key1'));
  console.log(data);

  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};
```

# Deployment region

Currently Upstash Redis supports only following regions:

- us-east-1
- us-west-1
- us-west-2
- eu-west-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-southeast-1
- ap-southeast-2
- sa-east-1

If you are deploying your stack in some other region, Stacktape will try to deploy the database in the region
geographically closest to the region of your stack.

# Enable Eviction

-   When enabled, Redis will automatically evict keys when memory limit is reached.
-   Uses optimistic-volatile algorithm (combination of volatile-random and allkeys-random policies).
-   Allows older data to be automatically removed to make room for new data.

```yml
providerConfig:
  upstash:
    accountEmail: xxxxx.yyyy@example.com
    apiKey: $Secret('upstash-api-key')

resources:
  myUpstash:
    type: upstash-redis
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      enableEviction: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```
