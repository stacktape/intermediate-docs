# Overview

- MongoDb Atlas cluster is a schema-less, NoSQL database fully managed by MongoDB Inc. Unlike other resources, MongoDb
  Atlas cluster is not an AWS-native service. However, Stacktape seamlessly integrates it into your stacks.

- MongoDb Atlas cluster is a secure, scalable, highly available and performant database. It has built-in replication,
  supports backups and Point-In-Time recovery.

- Every stack that includes a MongoDb Atlas cluster will additionally create a new
  [MongoDB Atlas project](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/). This ensures isolation between
  stacks.

- MongoDb includes an SDK for virtually any programming language. It allows you to easily query your database.
  Furthermore, you can configure MongoDb clusters to use a BI (Business Intelligence) connector that allows an SQL-based
  access.

# When to use

<NegativeMargin />

## Advantages

- **Secure**
- **Scalable**
- **Performant**
- **Supports backups and Point-In-Time recovery**
- **High availability**
- **Supports Multi-Document ACID Transactions**

## Disadvantages

- **Separate billing** - Even though Stacktape seamlessly integrates MongoDb to your stacks, you still need to manage
  your billing separately.

# Provider configuration

- You must have a MongoDb Atlas account. To create one, head over to
  [MongoDb Atlas registration page](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register).

- You need following to configure the provider:

  - Atlas Mongo `organizationId`
  - Atlas Mongo `publicKey`
  - Atlas Mongo `privateKey`

- You can obtain them by following [our step-by-step guide](/user-guides/mongo-db-atlas-credentials/).
- The recommended way to store your credentials is to use [secrets](/resources/secrets/).

# Cluster tier

- Configures resources (memory, default storage, IOPS specification) for each data-bearing node in the cluster
- To learn more about cluster tiers, refer to
  [MongoDb Atlas cluster tier docs](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/cluster-tier/) and
  [list of available cluster tier](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/amazon-aws/#cluster-configuration-options).

```yml
# {start-ignore}
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'
# {stop-ignore}
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: 'mongo-db-atlas-cluster'
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      clusterTier: M2
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Disk size

- Each cluster tier comes with a default storage size.
- All M10+ clusters auto-scale the storage without any manual intervention. You can disable this behavior by
  [configuring autoscaling properties](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters#auto-scaling)
- All M10+ clusters also provide the ability to customize your storage capacity.

```yml
# {start-ignore}
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'
# {stop-ignore}
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M2
      # {start-highlight}
      diskSizeGB: 60
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Auto-scaling

-   You can configure your cluster to automatically scale its cluster tier, storage capacity, or both based on the cluster usage.
-   To help control the costs, you can select a range of cluster tiers to which your cluster can scale to.
-   Cluster is `scaled up` (to the next tier), if one the following criteria is met:
    -   Average CPU Utilization has exceeded 75% for the past hour
    -   Memory Utilization has exceeded 75% for the past hour
-   Cluster is `scaled down` (to the lower tier), if both of the following criteria are met:
    -   The average CPU Utilization and Memory Utilization over the past 24 hours is below 50%
    -   The cluster has not been scaled down (manually or automatically) in the past 24 hours

```yml
# {start-ignore}
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'

        maxClusterTier: M30
        disableDiskScaling: true
        disableScaleDown: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Sharding

-   If you configure more than 1 shard, the cluster will run in a sharded mode.
-   Sharding distributes data across multiple physical machines enabling horizontal scaling.
-   Sharded mode is available only for cluster tiers M30 or higher.
-   To learn more about sharding, refer to [MongoDb Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/sharding).

```yml
# {start-ignore}

  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'
# {stop-ignore}
resources:
  myMongoCluster:

    properties:
      clusterTier: M30
      # {start-highlight}
      numShards: 3
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Backups

-   Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the event of a data loss.
-   The default snapshot time is **every day at 18:00 UTC**.
-   Available only in M10+ Clusters.
-   Snapshots are automatically taken even for M2/M5 clusters, but have different properties. To learn more, refer to \[M2 and M5 backups docs\]([https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/backup-restore-cluster/#m2](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/backup-restore-cluster/#m2)

There are different types of snapshots with different retention period and frequency:

- **Hourly snapshot**: every 6 hours, retained for 2 days
- **Daily snapshot**: every day, retained for 7 days
- **Weekly snapshot**: every Saturday, retained for 4 weeks
- **Monthly snapshot**: last day of the month, retained for 12 months

```yml
# {start-ignore}
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'

    properties:
      clusterTier: M10
      # {start-highlight}
      enableBackups: true
      # {stop-highlight}
```

# Point-in-time recovery

-   Enables Continuous Cloud Backups, which replay the oplog (history of ordered logical writes) and enables you to restore a cluster from a particular point in time.
-   You can make a point in time recovery to any point within the **last 7 days**.
-   Available only in M10+ Clusters.
-   If you enable point-in-time recovery, you must also enable backups.
-   MongoDb Continuous cloud backup includes additional charges. To learn more, refer to [MongoDb Continuous cloud backup pricing Docs](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/billing/cluster-configuration-costs/#continuous-cloud-backups)

# Accessing clusters from workloads

- Following example shows how to grant a lambda **function** _myMongoFunction_ a permission to access your
  **mongo-db-atlas-cluster** _myMongoCluster_.

- By listing _myMongoCluster_ in **connectTo** of _myMongoFunction_, function is injected with credentials needed for
  accessing the cluster.

```yml
# {start-ignore}
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'
# {stop-ignore}

resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: 'mongo-db-atlas-cluster'
    properties:
      clusterTier: M2

  myMongoFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'lambdas/mongo-lambda.ts'
      memory: 512
      # {start-highlight}
      # by allowing access to cluster, lambda receives permissions for reading and writing into cluster databases
      connectTo:
        - myMongoCluster
      # {stop-highlight}
      environment:
        # injecting the connection string as environment variable
        - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
          value: $ResourceParam('myMongoCluster', 'connectionString')
```

# Accessibility

- Stacktape allows you to restrict the accessibility of your MongoDb cluster to only certain resources or hosts.
- In contrary to other Stacktape database resources, accessibility is set globally in your MongoDb Atlas provider
  configuration, and not on the resource itself. This means every MongoDb cluster in the given stack must have the same
  accessibility mode.
- When using shared cluster tiers (M2 and M5), you must set accessibility mode to `internet`. This is because shared
  clusters does not support VPC peering. clusters(M10+). and therefore do not allow for same level of network
  inter-connection. Nevertheless, even when using accessibility set to `internet`, clusters are still protected as
  Stacktape utilizes strict identity access management between your stack compute resources (functions,
  multi-container-workloads, batch-jobs) and atlas mongo clusters. See section
  [Accessing clusters from workloads](#accessing-clusters-from-workloads)

<PropertiesTable definitionName="MongoDbAtlasAccessibility" searchForReferencesInDefinition="MongoDbAtlasProvider" />

## Internet mode

- Default mode. Least restrictive. The cluster can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.
- Your MongoDB cluster is still protected, because any host or resource (workload) trying to access your cluster
  requires IAM (Identity and Access management) permissions (it is also possible to use [admin user](#admin-user) name
  and password, but using these credentials is only **recommended in cases you cannot use IAM permissions**).
- You can grant IAM permissions to your compute resources by configuring `connectTo` on your
  ([functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions/#connecting-to-resources),
  [container workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads/#connecting-to-resources) or
  [batch jobs](/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#connecting-to-resources))

## VPC mode

- In addition to being protected by IAM (Identity and Access management) as described in
  [Internet mode](#internet-mode), the mongo cluster is also protected on a network level. This means, that only
  [functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) (which have `joinDefaultVpc` set to true),
  [batch jobs](/compute-resources/batch-jobs) or [container workloads](/compute-resources/multi-container-workloads)
  within your stack can access the cluster.

- Additionally, IP addresses configured in `whitelistedIps` can also access the cluster (even from the internet).

- When using this mode, the traffic which originates from your stack resources (workloads) to your mongo cluster never
  leaves AWS network infrastructure. This makes the communication cheaper and more secure.

```yml
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    # {start-highlight}
    # "accessibility" option is shared between "mongo-db-atlas-cluster" resources of your stack
    accessibility:
      accessibilityMode: vpc
    # {stop-highlight}
    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'

resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10
```

## Scoping workloads in VPC mode

- Similar to **vpc** mode, but even more restrictive in terms of network protection. When using this mode `connectTo`
  not only grants the required IAM (Identity and Access management) permissions, but also grants access on the network
  level.

- Additionally, IP addresses configured in `whitelistedIps` can also access the database (even from the internet).

- When using this mode, the traffic which originates from your stack resources (workloads) to your mongo cluster never
  leaves AWS network infrastructure. This makes the communication cheaper and more secure.

```yml
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    # {start-highlight}

        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'path/to/my-lambda.ts'
      joinDefaultVpc: true

  # functionTwo does have access to database, because it is scoping the database in connectTo list
  functionTwo:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: 'path/to/my-lambda-2.ts'
      joinDefaultVpc: true
      # {start-highlight}

      # {stop-highlight}

  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10
```

## Whitelisted IPs only mode

- The database can only be accessed from an IP addresses and CIDR blocks listed in the `whitelistedIps` list.

```yml
providerConfig:
  mongoDbAtlas:
    privateKey: 'xxxxfa523543fxxxx42543xx'
    publicKey: 'xxxxxxx'
    # {start-highlight}
    # "accessibility" option is shared between "mongo-db-atlas-cluster" resources of your stack
    accessibility:
      accessibilityMode: whitelisted-ips-only
      whitelistedIps:
        - 193.12.16.4

    organizationId: 'xxxxxxxxxxx07a593cbe63dd'
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10
```

# Admin user

-   Optionally, you can create an admin database user user with [administrative access privileges](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-add-mongodb-users/#mongodb-atlasrole-Atlas-admin).
-   Accessing the cluster from your compute resources (batch-jobs, multi-container-workloads, functions or container based services), is possible even without creating this user.
-   Creating an admin user can be useful for performing administrative tasks, or when connecting to the cluster from a local machine.
