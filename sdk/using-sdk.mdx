## Overview

- SDK offers a programmatic way of interacting with the Stacktape API.
- Unlike other Infastructure as Code tools such as AWS CDK or Pulumi, it offers a truly dynamic way of interacting with
  your stacks (as opposed to just programmatically creating the configuration).
- Behind the scenes, Stacktape SDK interacts with a GRPC server that executes Stacktape commands in a separate process.
- Currently, the SDK is available only for Javascript/Typescript. Python, Go and Java SDKs will be available soon.
- Stacktape SDK is fully typed and includes a built-in documentation for every property.

## Example usage

```ts
import { Stacktape } from 'stacktape';

const stacktape = new Stacktape({
  region: 'eu-west-1',
  stage: 'production'
});

const run = async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    stacktape.deploy({
      config: {
        serviceName: 'stack-1',
        resources: [
          /* ...your resources... */
        ]
      }
    }),
    stacktape.deploy({
      config: {
        serviceName: 'stack-2',
        resources: [
          /* ...your resources... */
        ]
      }
    })
  ]);
};

run();
```

> Example script written in typescript that concurrently deploys 2 different stacks.

## Print progress

- To print information about the operations that Stacktape performs, you can set the `printProgress` property.

```ts
const stacktape = new Stacktape({
  printProgress: true
});
```

## Subscribing to events

- Stacktape process sends events that describe what's currently happening. You can subscribe to these event

```ts
const stacktape = new Stacktape({
  onEvent: (eventData) => {
    // do something with the event data
  }
});
```
