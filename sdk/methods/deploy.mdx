# Overview and basic usage

<br />

Deploys the stack (specified stage of your project) to AWS.

<br />

- If the stack doesn't exist, creates a new one. If the stack already exists, updates it.
- Requires a valid stacktape configuration file in the current working directory or configuring a path to the config
  file using `--configPath` option.

const stacktape = new Stacktape();

stacktape.deploy({
  region: "<<region>>",
  stage: "<<stage>>"
});
