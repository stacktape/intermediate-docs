# Introduction

<br />

- To use [budget control](/configuration/budget-control/), you need to:

  1. **Enable cost explorer** in your account (if you have not used cost explorer previously) - **using root account**.
  2. Activate **Stacktape cost allocation tags** in the AWS console - **using root account**.

- This guide will walk you through both of these.

<Warning>

To complete this tutorial, you need to be logged in as AWS **root user (root account)**.

</Warning>

# 1. Enabling Cost Explorer

## 1.1. Go to Billing -> Cost Explorer page

Login to AWS console as a **root user** and visit
[cost explorer page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/costexplorer) in the billing section.

If this is your first time launching Cost Explorer you should receive the following message.

<Warning>

It can take up to 24 hours for Cost Explorer to be activated. This is an AWS limitation.

</Warning>

# 2. Activate cost allocation tags

- Activating cost allocation tags allows Stacktape to correctly aggregate costs of resources in your stacks.

- Stacktape automatically tags resources in your stacks with **custom tags**. Based on these tags, Cost Explorer can
  determine which resources are part of the stack and associate costs of these resources to the stack.

- For these **custom tags** to be usable by Cost Explorer, you need to activate them as **cost allocation tags**.

## 2.1. Go to Billing -> Cost allocation tags page

Login to AWS console and visit [cost allocation tags tab](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tags) in the
billing section.

## 2.2. Activate required cost allocation tags

The list will show all tags that have been previously used to tag a resource in this account.

If you have already deployed a stack using Stacktape, all the required tags should be listed here.

The following tags are required:

- `stp:globally-unique-stack-hash`
- `stp:service-name`
- `stp:stack-name`
- `stp:stage`

<Warning>

It can take up to 24 hours for these tags to appear in the console after being used. This is an AWS limitation.

</Warning>

Select all the required tags and activate them by clicking on `Activate` button in the top right corner.

![Activating tags](../static/enable-budgeting/selected-tags-2-modified.png)

After the activation, tags should be marked as `Active`.

<Warning>

It can take up to 24 hours after activating the tags before you can start using them in

<Link href="/configuration/budget-control">budget control</Link>. This is an AWS limitation.

</Warning>
