# Overview

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network. This virtual network resembles a traditional
  network in an on-premise data center.

- VPC allows you to control the access to resources connected to it. You can create subnets, IP address range, route
  tables and network gateways. Configuring VPCs manually is usually complicated, time-consuming and error-prone.

- Stacktape handles VPC configuration and management for you. In most cases, it doesn't require you to worry about VPCs
  at all while maintaining a high levels of security.

## Default VPC

- Certain AWS resources need to be connected to the VPC in order to work (this is enforced by AWS).

- For stacks that require these resources, Stacktape automatically creates a default VPC and connects the VPC-requiring
  resources to it.

## Communication with outer internet

- Resources inside a VPC by default can't communicate with the internet (make outbound requests).

- Resources that need to communicate with the internet can do that using 2 different approaches:

### Being connected to a public subnet

- Container workloads and batch jobs are connected to the public subnet by default. This means you can communicate with
  the internet without any extra effort.
- However, [lambda functions](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) can't be connected to the public subnet.

### Using a NAT Gateway

- A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private
  subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those
  instances.
- NAT Gateway are costly (you pay hourly charges, minimum 33$/month) and also data-processing and data-transfer charges.
- Stacktape currently doesn't use a NAT Gateway for any of its resources.
- To learn more about NAT Gateways, refer to
  [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html).
