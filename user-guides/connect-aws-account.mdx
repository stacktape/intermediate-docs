# Introduction

To deploy with Stacktape, your organization must have an AWS account connected. This tutorial will guide you through the
process of connecting your AWS account with Stacktape.

# Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account to complete this tutorial. If you do not have an AWS account, you can
[create one here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

# Step 1

After singing in to the [stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/), navigate to the
[AWS accounts page](https://console.stacktape.com/aws-accounts).

2. Continue by clicking `Connect Account in AWS Console` button. This will redirect you to your AWS console.

# Step 3 - Create Connection Stack

In the AWS console, you now need to create the connection stack. Connection stack is a set of resources that are
necessary for connecting your AWS account to Stacktape.

`Connection stack and its resources are free and do not incur any noticeable costs.` The stack includes an S3 bucket for
collecting cost reports (required for Stacktape cost analysis) and an IAM role that allows Stacktape access to your AWS
account.

<Warning>

If you delete the connection stack in the AWS console, you will no longer be able to use Stacktape.

</Warning>

After you confirm the stack creation, you will see the stack being created. Stack creation generally takes around 1
minute.

After the connection stack is successfully created, your AWS account is connected to Stacktape. You should see the
connected `AWS Account` marked `ACTIVE` in the
[stacktape console AWS accounts page](https://console.stacktape.com/aws-accounts)
