# Introduction

- [MongoDb Atlas clusters](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters) are managed outside of AWS and require you to configure
  [MongoDb Atlas provider](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters/#provider-configuration).

- To configure the provider, you need to have `organizationId`, `publicKey` and `privateKey`. This guide will walk you
  through getting them.

# 1. Create MongoDb Atlas account

If you don't have a MongoDb Atlas account yet, head over to
[MongoDb Atlas registration page](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register).

After you create the account, you will be able to "Choose a deployment option to get started.". You can skip this,
because Stacktape handles the database creation and deletion for you.

# 2. Add payment method

Next, you need to add a payment method (credit card).

Go to the billing page and click on the **ADD CREDIT CARD/PAYPAL** button.

After you log in, navigate to the **Organizations** screen from the dropdown menu in top right corner.

Now, you need to:

1. Configure organization name.
2. Select **MongoDB Atlas** as your cloud service.

Continue by clicking on the **Next** button.

On the following screen, you can optionally add members to your organization.

Continue by clicking on the **Create Organization** button.

After creating the organization, you will be redirected to the organization space, where you can get your organization
id.

# 4. Get Organization ID

Navigate to organization's **Settings**.

![Create organization - step 3](../static/mongodb-provider/screen4-mod.png)

On the **Settings** page, you will see your `organizationId`.

# 5. Get API keys

<br />

Navigate to the **Access Manager** page within the organization space.

![Create API Key- step 1](../static/mongodb-provider/screen6-mod.png)

In the **Access Management** page, select **API Keys** tab and continue by clicking on the **Create API Key** button.

![Create API Key- step 2](../static/mongodb-provider/screen7-mod.png)

On the following screen:

1. Input an arbitrary description for the key.
2. Select sufficient permissions for the key (`Organization Project Creator` or higher).

Continue by clicking on the **Next** button.

![Create API Key- step 3](../static/mongodb-provider/screen9-mod.png)

On the following screen you will see your **public** and **private** keys. Private key will not be available after you
leave this page.

The recommended way to store both keys is by using a [secret](/resources/secrets/).
