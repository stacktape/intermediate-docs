# Introduction

Stacktape allows you to easily develop your application in a **"development"** mode.

<br />

Different compute resource types have different ways to develop them.

<br />

The development mode is designed to be:

- Practical (fast feedback loop).
- Correct (as close to the production compute resource as possible).
- Intuitive and easy to use.
- Enjoyable (all the information you need in one place, pretty-printed logs, etc.)

# Developing application code of container workloads

<br />

The recommended way to develop a container workload is to use the [dev command](/cli/commands/dev/).

For example, to develop and debug container `api-container` within container workload named `apiServer`, you can use

```bash
stacktape dev --region eu-west-1 --stage <<your-previously-deployed-stage>> --resourceName apiServer
```

This will run the container locally, map all of the `containerPort`-s specified in the `events` section to the host
machine, and continuously pretty-print logs produced by the container.

<br />

Stacktape emulates the compute resource as closely to the deployed version as possible:

- Container's `environment` variables referenced by `$ResourceParam` and `$Secret` directives are automatically
  downloaded and injected to the compute resource.
- Temporary credentials of the container's
  [assumed role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) are injected to the compute
  resource. This means that your locally running container will have the exact same IAM permissions as the deployed
  version.

<br />

The container is rebuilt and restarted, when you either:

- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

# Developing application code of lambda functions

The recommended way to develop a container compute resource is to use the [dev command](/cli/commands/dev/).

```bash
stacktape dev --region eu-west-1 --stage <<your-previously-deployed-stage>> --resourceName getPosts
```

This will quickly build and deploy your function code, continuously watch for its logs, and pretty-print them to the
terminal.

The function is rebuilt and redeployed, when you either:

- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

# Developing application code of batch job

Local development mode for batch job is currently under development.
