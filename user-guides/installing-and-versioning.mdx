## Installing

### Install using an installation script

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: "iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n",
      label: "Windows (PowerShell)"
    },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n", label: "Linux" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n", label: "Macos" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n", label: "Macos ARM" }
  ]}
/>

- After the installation is complete, you might need to manually add Stacktape bin folder to the PATH environment
  variable. To do it, follow the instruction printed to the terminal.

### Install manually

- To install Stacktape manually, you can download it directly from
  [Github releases](https://github.com/stacktape/stacktape/releases) page.

- Extract the archive to any `<<home_folder>>/.stacktape/bin`.

- Add `<<home_folder>>/.stacktape/bin` to your PATH environment variable.

## Installing specific version

- To install a specific version, use `STACKTAPE_VERSION=<<version>>` environment variable before running the install
  script

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: '$env:STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n',
      label: "Windows (PowerShell)"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n',
      label: "Linux"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n',
      label: "Macos"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n',
      label: "Macos ARM"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Semantic versioning

Stacktape tries to follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) as closely as possible.

There might be a small breaking change introduced in minor version from time to time, but all of these are documented on
the [releases page](https://github.com/stacktape/stacktape/releases).
