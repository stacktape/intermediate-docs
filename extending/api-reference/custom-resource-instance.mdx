This example shows a basic custom resource instance configuration.

Custom resource instance

- Used to create resources inside your stack that are not natively supported by AWS Cloudformation, or to provision services from other providers.

# Basic example

```yml
resources:
  myCustomResourceInstance:
    type: custom-resource-instance
    properties:
      # Name of the `custom-resource-definition` to use
      #
      # - Type: string
      # - Required: true
      definitionName: myDefinitionName
      # Properties passed to the custom resource instance
      #
      # - These properties will be accessible to the custom resource lambda function during execution
      #
      # - Type: object
      # - Required: true
```
