# Overview

AWS CDK(Cloud Development Kit) allows you to use common programming languages to model your application infrastructure.

<br />

A basic building block when using CDK is a **construct**. A construct represents a reusable "cloud component"
encapsulating everything AWS needs to create the component. It can represent a single AWS resource, such as an Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or be a higher-level abstraction consisting of multiple related AWS resources.

<br />

Stacktape allows you to extend your infrastructure by adding **AWS CDK constructs** to stacktape resources. AWS
resources which are part of the construct are then deployed together with other AWS resources created by Stacktape.

To learn more about constructs refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html).
Furthermore, [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/search?q=&cdk=aws-cdk&cdkver=2&sort=downloadsDesc&offset=0) is a
resource to help you discover additional constructs from AWS, third parties, and the open-source CDK community.

# Usage

Currently, Stacktape supports using constructs written in Javascript or Typescript. You can create your custom construct
by extending `Construct` class.

```ts
import { Duration } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as sns from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns';
import * as subs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns-subscriptions';
import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class MyConstruct extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: { visibilityTimeout: number }) {
    super(scope, id);
    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'Queue', {
      visibilityTimeout: Duration.seconds(props?.visibilityTimeout || 300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'Topic');

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

> Example construct (containing multiple AWS resources)

```yml
resources:
  myConstruct:
    type: aws-cdk-construct
    properties:
      entryfilePath: my-construct.ts
      exportName: MyConstruct
      constructProperties:
        visibilityTimeout: 50
```
