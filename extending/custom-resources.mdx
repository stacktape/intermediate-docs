# Overview

Custom resources enable you to create resources with custom provisioning logic. This enables users to specify execution
logic for resource creation, update, and deletion therefore allowing users to execute any kind of logic during stack
deploy/delete. Moreover, it gives users the ability to provision any type of resource that is not included among
Stacktape or Cloudformation resources. That way, users can manage all related resources in a single stack.

## When to use

**Provisioning non-AWS resources** - While AWS offers huge amount of services and resources, in some cases, AWS might
not offer a solution(resource) for your use-case, and often time a third-party solution better fits your needs. For
example: using **Auth0** over **Cognito** or using **Algolia** over **AWS Elasticsearch**. These non-AWS resources can
be provisioned using custom resources.

<Info>

If you are not provisioning custom resource but are looking for a way to execute custom logic during deployment process
take a look at [deployment scripts](/resources/deployment-scripts)

</Info>

{/* 2. **Performing provisioning steps not related to infrastructure** - Deployment of infrastructure is only a part of
   having the application successfully running. You might need to seed the database or run migrations, both of which are
   a great fit for a custom resource. Another example might be running a smoke test from your custom resource to ensure
   that everything is running correctly after deployment. */}

{/* 3. **Any other use case** - Since you are fully in control of the code and therefore of what the custom resource does,
   there is virtually no limit of how to use custom resources. Custom resources can be powerful, but we advise users to
   be reasonable with them.  */}

# Usage

In Stacktape, custom resources are made of two parts:

1. [custom-resource-definition](#custom-resource-definition) - definition is special type of lambda function. It
   contains the custom logic - the code, which gets executed each time **custom-resource-instance** is created, updated,
   or deleted. To put into perspective of standard programming languages: **custom-resource-definition** is like a class
   and **custom-resource-instance** is instance of this class.

2. [custom-resource-instance](#custom-resource-instance) - when you specify instance, you must specify
   **custom-resource-definition** _definitionName_ (which you want to instantiate) and _resourceProperties_(which can be
   thought of as arguments), which will be passed to the executing code.

All parts of a custom resource are shown in the following snippet. Individual parts are explained in the subsequent
sections.

The following example shows a custom resource that is used to seed a mongo cluster.

```yml
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10

  mongoSeeder:
    type: custom-resource-definition
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: seed-the-mongo-cluster.ts
      connectTo:
        - myMongoCluster

  seedMongoCluster:
    type: custom-resource-instance
    properties:
      definitionName: mongoSeeder
      resourceProperties:
        mongoConnectionString: $Param('myMongoCluster', 'AtlasMongoCluster::SrvConnectionString')
```

# Custom resource definition

Custom resource definition is similar to [function](/compute-resources/lambda-functions) definition. This is because on
the background **custom-resource-definition** leverages lambda functions.

<PropertiesTable
  definitionName="CustomResourceDefinition"
  rewriteLinksForReferencedCompositeTypes={{
    StpBuildpackLambdaPackaging: "#code-of-custom-resource",
    CustomArtifactLambdaPackaging: "#code-of-custom-resource"
  }}
/>

```yml
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10

  # {start-highlight}
  mongoSeeder:
    type: custom-resource-definition
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: seed-the-mongo-cluster.ts
      connectTo:
        - myMongoCluster
  # {stop-highlight}

  seedMongoCluster:
    type: custom-resource-instance
    properties:
      definitionName: mongoSeeder
      resourceProperties:
        mongoConnectionString: $Param('myMongoCluster', 'AtlasMongoCluster::SrvConnectionString')
```

## Code of custom resource

Package configuration allows you to specify a path to your code and other package properties. The code contains a logic
of your custom resource.

Code is during deployment packaged and executed as lambda functions. Refer to lambda functions
[packaging docs](/configuration/packaging#packaging-lambda-functions).

```yml
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10

  mongoSeeder:
    type: custom-resource-definition
    properties:
      # {start-highlight}
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: seed-the-mongo-cluster.ts
      # {stop-highlight}
      connectTo:
        - myMongoCluster

  seedMongoCluster:
    type: custom-resource-instance
    properties:
      definitionName: mongoSeeder
      resourceProperties:
        mongoConnectionString: $Param('myMongoCluster', 'AtlasMongoCluster::SrvConnectionString')
```

### Code example

The following example shows the code of our seeding custom resource in file **seed-the-mongo-cluster.ts**

See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/crpg-ref.html) to learn more
about:

- the type of requests (events) custom resource receives during stack operations
- response objects which you should return during respective operations

```ts
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import { SUCCESS, FAILED, send } from 'cfn-response-promise';

// {start-highlight}
// incoming event is in following form
// {stop-highlight}
// {
//   "RequestType" : "Create" || "Update" || "Delete",
//   "RequestId" : "9db53695-b0a0-47d6-908a-ea2d8a3ab5d7",
//   "ResponseURL" : "https://...",
//   "ResourceType" : "AWS::Cloudformation::CustomResource",
//   "LogicalResourceId" : "...",
//   "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:...",
//   "ResourceProperties" : {
//      ... properties of custom-resource-instance
//   }
// }

export default async (event, context) => {
  // custom resource definition code
  let success = true;
  let dataToReturn = {};

  try {
    // we are only seeding database if the operation is Create
    if (event.RequestType === 'Create') {
      // {start-highlight}
      // we are using the "mongoConnectionString" property passed by custom-resource-instance to create connection
      const connection = await mongoose.connect(event.ResourceProperties.mongoConnectionString, {
        // {stop-highlight}
        authMechanism: 'MONGODB-AWS',
        authSource: '$external',
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
        dbName: 'my-test-database'
      });
      // code with seeding the database ...
      // ...
    }
  } catch (err) {
    success = false;
  }
  await send(event, context, success ? SUCCESS : FAILED, dataToReturn, 'customresourceid');
};

// {start-highlight}
// function must respond to "ResponseURL" with response in following form
// we are using "cfn-response-promise" library which formats response for us
// {stop-highlight}
// {
//   "Status" : "SUCCESS" || "FAILED",
//   "RequestId" : "9db53695-b0a0-47d6-908a-ea2d8a3ab5d7",
//   "LogicalResourceId" : "...",
//   "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:...",
//   "PhysicalResourceId" : "...",
//   "Data" : {
//     ... attributes which can be queried in template using $Param
//   }
// }
```

## Accessing other resources

- For most of the AWS resources, resource-to-resource communication is not allowed by default. This helps to enforce
  security and resource isolation. Access must be explicitly granted using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (Identity
  and Access Management) permissions.

- Access control of [Relational Databases](/resources/relational-databases) is not managed by IAM. These resources are
  not "cloud-native" and have their own access control mechanism (connection string with username and password). They
  are accessible by default, and you don't need to grant any extra IAM permissions. If the default,
  connection-string-based access-control is not sufficient for your use case, you can restrict connection to only
  resources in the same VPC. In that case, your function must
  [join that VPC](/compute-resources/lambda-functions#default-vpc-connection) to access them.

- Stacktape automatically handles IAM permissions for the underlying AWS services that it creates (i.e. granting
  function permission to write logs to Cloudwatch, or allowing to communicate with their event source and many others).

- If your compute resource needs to communicate with other infrastructure components, you need to add permissions
  manually. You can do this in 2 ways listed below.

## Using connectTo

- List of resource names or AWS services that this function will be able to access (basic IAM permissions will be
  granted automatically). Granted permissions differ based on the resource.
- Works only for resources managed by Stacktape in `resources` section (not arbitrary Cloudformation resources)
- This is useful if you don't want to deal with IAM permissions yourself. Handling permissions using raw IAM role
  statements can be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, when using `connectTo` property, Stacktape
  **automatically injects information about resource** you are connecting to as environment variables into your custom
  resource runtime.

By referencing resources (or services) in `connectTo` list, Stacktape automatically:

-   configures correct compute resource's **IAM role permissions** if needed
-   sets up correct **security group rules** to allow access if needed
-   **injects relevant environment variables** containing information about resource you are connecting to into the compute resource's runtime
    -   names of environment variables use upper-snake-case and are in form `STP_[RESOURCE_NAME]_[VARIABLE_NAME]`,
    -   examples: `STP_MY_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `STP_MY_EVENT_BUS_ARN`,
    -   list of injected variables for each resource type can be seen below.

In this example, we are granting access to the mongo cluster. This will
[inject credentials for access](/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters#accessing-clusters-from-workloads) which are used in
[code](#code-example).

```yml
resources:
  myMongoCluster:
    type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
    properties:
      clusterTier: M10

  mongoSeeder:

# Custom resource instance

**Custom-resource-instance**, creates instance of specified **custom-resource-definition**. Depending on the action
(create/update/delete) stack is undergoing, the instance receives event (see [code example](#code-example)) and executes
the code.
